At the end, the rectangular strip EDFC of breadth 30 ang. is made and divided into 4 squares, 30 x 30 sq. ang. each. Each square is diagonally cut and the outer half removed. ABCD whose area is 2 sq. pu. is equivalent of 33 sodasi bricks. An area equivalent of 2 sodasis is discarded by diagonally cutting the 4 squares, leaving an area equal to that of 31 sodasi bricks.

The point G is obtained by making GH equal to 1 pu. GA, GE, HB and HF are joined. Each of these sides equals 1 pu.

18.6-18.8. The wings. A sq. pu. equals a rectangular area, 120 ang. long by 71 ang, broad. If this area is added to the rectangle, 240 ang. × 120 ang. along the common side 120 ang., we get the rectangle ABCD so that AB CD 120 ang. and AD BC= 247 ang. (Fig. 19(a)).

At the end, the rectangular strip EDFC of breadth 30 ang. is made and divided into 4 squares, 30 × 30 sq. ang. each. Each square is diagonally cut and the outer half removed. ABCD whose area is 2 sq. pu. is equivalent of 33 ṣoḍaśi bricks. An area equivalent of 2 sodasis is discarded by diagonally cutting the 4 squares, leaving an area equal to that of 31 ṣoḍaśi bricks. 
In the middle of the rectangle less the portion where four squares were drawn up, the east-west line GHI is drawn perpendicular to the sides BF, AE. BF is 2171⁄2 ang. and BI 108§ ang. The point H on the east-west line is obtained by stretching a cord or a rod of 1 pu. such that BH equals 1 p.u.

The point G is obtained by making GH equal to 1 pu. GA, GE, HB and HF are joined. Each of these sides equals 1 pu.

COMMENTARY 
these 18 squares are 18 ṣoḍaśīs, that is, 18 sq pu. or 900 × 18 sq. ang. The required side is therefore 1√18 pu. or 30/18 ang. The point is explained by Karavinda as follows: aṣṭādaśa karotītyaṣṭādaśakaraṇi | ṣoḍaśīnām prakṛtatvātṭāsām aṣṭādaśānāṁ karaṇi | te khalu triṣoḍaśipramāṇanavatyangulasamacaturaśrasyākṣṇayābhūte / Thus, Karavinda puts it as the diagonal of a square of side 90 ang. (Fig. 19(b)), which again equals 30V18 ang. That the area of the tail is equivalent to that of 15 ṣoḍasis is clear from the figure. 
19.2-19.8. Types of bricks. 6 types of bricks have been used in covering the alternate. layers of the fire-altar. These are-

of sides and † pu. The shape is so given that one diagonal ac is longer than the other bd, whose dimensions are given by Sundararāja as 40 ang. 12 ti and 27 ang. 20 ti. The purpose is to make it fit in the wing, so that the inclinations are similar to those of the wing at either side of the bending. Clearly de is of 108₫ ang. or 15 ang. 18 ti (Sundararāja gives this value as 15 ang. 18 ti). The shapes of B4, B, and B. are further explained in 19.8.

The brick suitable for use at the end of the tail (pakṣāgriyā) broken in the form of four triangles. It consists of two parts, e.g. parallelogram abcd and the triangle ecd, and is a combination of B and B2 joined about the common side pu. The inclination is so adjusted that the parallelo- gram part fits in the parallelogram part and the triangular in the triangular part of the wing. 
19.9-20.4. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks is clearly explained in Fig. 21. The rules start with the placement of B, bricks, -4 at the tip of the head ABC, 5 west of the line DE, 11 east of the line KF joining the eastern points of juncture of the wings with the body, 11 west of JG, the western line of juncture, 5 each on the eastern and the western side of IH, the junction line between the tail and the body, and finally 15 at the end of the tail LM. Thus 56 Bs are used (tã evaitāḥ ṣaṭpañcāśatpādeṣṭakāḥ—Kapardi). 
4Bs are placed at each end OP of the two wings, such that the triangular parts cover the triangular ends and the parallelogram parts part of the adjoining para- llelogram of the wing. 4 B¿s are placed at either junction FG, JK of the wings with the body such that the triangular parts lie in the body. The total number of B ̧s used is 16. North of FG and south of JK each, 4 B1 bricks are placed in the body with their diagonally cut sides fitting exactly with the similar diagonal sides of the Bes. The remaining space in either wing is covered by 4 B5 at the bending MN and by 40 Bas, -20 B1s each on either side of the bending; Bs are turned eastwards. (catvārimsată catvāriṛśatā pakṣeṣṭakābhiḥ prāgāyatābhiḥ pakṣau pracchadayet-Karavinda). 
The spaces of the fire-altar now left out are in the head between the rows of B, bricks, in the body between the B ̧s at the eastern and western ends and in the middle enclosed on east and west sides by Bs and on south and north sides by B1s, and in the tail between Bgs at the juncture and the end. These spaces are to be

covered by B1s, such that at the inclined edges at the four corners of the body and the two sides of the tail, the diagonal sides (†√2 pu., saviśeṣāh, as Kapardi explains) face outwards; elsewhere 2 B1s lie with their diagonals touching each other so as to form a rectangle 60 ang. x 30 ang., as the geometry clearly indicates. The number of bricks and their types in the different parts of the fire-altar are given in Table 7.

20.5-20.12. Placement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, 2 B1s are placed at the tip of the head with their diagonal sides facing outwards. West of them 2 B1s are placed, partly covering the head and the body, but with their diagonal sides. facing inwards. There are two ways of doing it, as shown in Fig. 22(a) and (b). The space between the two diagonals is filled by 2 B2s on each side of the 2 B1s at the juncture, 1 B1⁄2 being placed with its diagonal side facing outwards. Thereafter, B1 bricks are to be placed at the corners of the body. Bürk, in his Fig. 63a, placed 6 such bricks,-2 in the eastern and 4 in the western corners. All commentators have interpreted rule 20.7 as the placement of 4 B1s, one in each of the 4 corners (śronyamseṣu catasraḥ ṣoḍaśyo vahyaviseṣāḥ pratyantaviseṣaḥ Kapardi. tāsām sandhiṣu... 
2 
..sodasyaḥ catasrah-Karavinda.) The placing of 2 B,s,-one on either side of the western corners, to maintain the symmetry with the eastern corners, has also been suggested. The rules then direct the placement of 4 Bgs at the end of each wing, 6 B2s at both sides of the tail (3 on each) and B1s in the wings turned towards north 20.8, 20.9). From the geometry of the wing, it is clear that the parallelogram spaces in either wing can be divided exactly into 56 (7 × 8) small parallelograms for containing 56 B1s. Bürk's Fig. 63 shows 64 (8 × 8) which is incorrect. About 56 B1s, Kapardi says: ṣatpañcāśadviparyasya kāritāḥ; about 7 rows south north, in the wings, Karavinda's statement is : pakṣayorudicyaḥ pakṣeṣṭakāḥ sapta ritayaḥ | 
■ Bürk, 385

ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASUTRA 
Rule 20.10 directs that the remaining space in the body and the tail is to be covered by B1s. Now, after covering the body with 4 B1s and 4 B2s and part of 2 B1s at the juncture with the head (total area covered is equivalent of 7 ṣoḍaśi bricks), a space equivalent of 33 șoḍaśi bricks remains to be filled up; in the tail, the space yet to be covered is clearly that of 12 ṣoḍaśis. Hence, Karavinda's comment-- avaśiṣṭamātmani trayastrimśat ṣoḍaśŝisthānam pucchadvādaśa ṣoḍaśisthānam. With 18 bricks placed in the head, body and tail, 120 in the two wings and 45 sodasi-spaces, the total number comes to 183. Then the geometry of the remaining space in the body is such that only 30 B1s can be accommodated and the remaining three soḍaśi spaces (30x30 sq. ang.) can be covered by 4 B2s and 4 B2s (20.11). In that way, Kapardi arrived at 188 bricks, still short of 12 (evam dvādaśonam śatadvayam () The arrangement of 188 bricks is shown in Fig. 22(a). 
The deficit of 12 bricks can be met by replacing 12 B1s by Bs and Bs, as indicated in 20.11. The role of aṇukās, 30 × 30 sq. ang., in parallelogram form is not properly understood, for the same objective can be achieved by half bricks (B2).

However, a complete scheme explaining how 200 bricks can be laid in the second layer has been given by Karavinda. There is no change in the arrangement of bricks in the two wings, totalling 120. Accordingly, the placement of bricks in the head, the body and the tail only is shown in Fig. 22(b). The head and its juncture with the body are covered, as in Fig. 22(a), by 4 B1s and 2 B2s; at the juncture the dispositions of 2 B1s and 2 B2s are reversed: sirasi prānmukhe bāhyaviseṣe dve ṣoḍaśyau upadadhyāt | tayoḥ paścāt prāňmukhe bāhyaviśeṣe visaye dve ardhe | tayoḥ

The body west of the line AB is divided into six rows in the east-west direction : tataḥ paścāt ātmani pracyaṣṣaḍritayaḥ | Beginning from the south, the first row contains 8 bricks,--1 B1 at each of the eastern and the western corners and 6 Bs in between. The second row has 2 B1s at the western corner end, then 1 B1, 6 B¿§, again 1 B1 and 2 B2s, of which the one at the eastern corner has already been mentioned. There are thus 12 bricks (dvādaśeṣṭakā eṣā |) In the third layer, starting from west of the juncture line AB upto the line of juncture CD in the tail, there are 8 B1s, of which 4 are turned eastwards and 4 westwards: tṛtiyasyam rityām siro’pyayaṣoḍaśyāḥ paścă- dārabhya āpucchāpyayamaṣṭau ṣoḍaśya upadheyāḥ | tāsām catasraḥ prācyaścatasraḥ praticyaḥ| The arrangements in the 4th, 5th and 6th rows are the same as those in the 3rd, 2nd and 1st respectively.

In the tail, 3 B2s are placed on either side as before. In the second row, south- north, the remaining space is covered by 2 B1s in the middle and 2 B2s on either side, and in the last row at the end by 6 B1s as in Fig. 22(a). The total number of bricks and their types, as per Karavinda's description, are given in Table 8.
