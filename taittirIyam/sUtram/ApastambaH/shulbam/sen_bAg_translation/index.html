We shall explain the methods of constructing (different) figures (on the ground for building sacrificial altars).
A cord of length equal to a given measure is increased by its half so that the whole length is divided into three parts of half the measure each. In the third part on the western side, a mark is given at a point shorter by one-sixth (of the third part). With the two ties fastened to the two ends of the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā) the cord is stretched towards the south by the mark and a pole is fixed on it. The same is done towards the north. The same is repeated on the other side (eastern) after interchanging the ties. Thus are determined (the four corners of the right rectilinear figure). Thereby the sides are shortened or lengthened.
Alternatively, a cord of a given measure is increased by its length; the original length plus its fourth part will constitute the diagonal and the remaining (three-fourth part of the length) the breadth (of the rectangle). Thereby, the construction of a (right rectilinear) figure is explained.
The areas (of the squares) produced separately by the length and the breadth of a rectangle together equal the area (of the square) produced by the diagonal. By the understanding of these (methods) the construction of the figures as stated (is to be accomplished).
The diagonal of a square produces double the area (of the square). It is √2 (dvikaraņi) of the side of the square (of which it is the diagonal).
The measure is to be increased by its third and this (third) again by its own fourth less the thirty-fourth part (of the fourth); this is (the value of) the diagonal of a square (whose side is the measure).
Here is another method (of construction of a square). Ties are made at both ends of a cord of length equal to the given measure. Marks are given at its middle and at mid points of its two halves. After stretching the cord along the east-west line poles are fixed at the ties and the marks. With the two ties fixed at the two poles at the two outer marks (mid-points of two halves), the cord is stretched towards the south by the middle mark and a sign is given (at the point reached). With the two ties fixed at the middle pole, the cord is (again) stretched by its middle mark towards the south over the sign (previ- ously made) and a pole is fixed (at the point reached). With one tie (of the cord) fixed at this pole and the other tie at the eastern pole, the south- eastern corner is (now) obtained by (stretching the cord with) its middle mark. By removing the tie from the eastern pole and fixing it to the western pole, the south-western corner is likewise obtained by (stretching

the cord with) the middle mark. In the same manner, the north-western and the north-eastern corners (are obtained).
2
Now another method of construction (of a square). Poles are fixed at both ends and in the middle of the east-west line. A cord measuring half of the east-west line is taken and increased by its viśeșa (the difference between its length and the diagonal of the square produced by it). After giving a mark at this point, the cord is (further) increased by half of the east-west line. Ties are made at both ends of the cord. Fixing the tie at the saviśeșa end at the middle pole and the other tie at the eastern pole, the cord is stretched by the mark so as to obtain the south-eastern corner. By removing the tie from the eastern pole and fixing it to the western pole, the south-western corner is likewise obtained by (stretching the cord with) the mark. In the same way, the north-western and the north-eastern corners (are obtained).
The breadth (of a rectangle) being the side of a given square (pramāṇa) and the length the side of a square twice as large (dvikaraṇī), the diagonal equals the side of a square thrice as large (tṛkarani).
Thereby is explained the side of a square one-third the area of a given square (tṛtiyakaraņi). It is the side of a square one-ninth the area of the square (explained in the preceding rule, that is, of the square on the tṛkaraṇī).
The combination of two equal squares has been described. The combination of two squares of unequal measures (sides) (now) follows. A (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller; the diagonal of the cut-off (rectangular) part (produces the square which) combines both the squares. This has been stated.
If it is desired to remove a square from another, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller one to be removed; the (longer) side of the cut-off (rectangular) part is placed across so as to touch the opposite side; by this contact (the side) is cut off. With the cut-off (part) the difference (of the two squares) is obtained.
That (the longer side of the cut-off rectangle in the above rule) which is placed across is the diagonal equal to the side of a square four times as large (as the given square). The area (of the squares) produced separately by the cut-off side and the other (the breadth of the rectangle) together equal the the area (of the square) produced by this diagonal. If the breadth produces one square purușa, the other side produces three square purușas. This has been stated.
If it is desired to transform a rectangle into a square, a (square) part is cut off (from the rectangle) by the breadth. The remainder (of the rectangle) is divided (into two equal parts) and placed on two sides. The empty space (in the corner) is filled up with a (square) piece. The removal of it (of the

If it is desired to transform a square into a rectangle, the side is made as long as desired; (after diagonal intersection), what remains as excess portion is to be placed where it fits. (Like Bśl. 2.4, the rule is defective and does not lead to proper geometrical operation).
If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, a cord is stretched from the centre (of the square) upto its corner (so as to measure out a length equal to half the diagonal). It is (then) stretched (from the centre) towards the (eastern) side. With one-third of the excess part (lying outside the eastern side) added (to the portion of the cord between the centre and the side), the (required) circle is drawn. This is the (approximate) circle, for (almost) as much is added as is cut off (from the corners of the square).
To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into fifteen parts and two of them are removed, leaving thirteen parts. This gives the approxi- mate (side of the) square (desired).
The (square) measure is to be done by means of the (linear) measure. A square (of unit area) is to be understood in the absence of anything to the
contrary.
(A cord of length) twice the measure produces four (square measures); thrice the measure nine (square measures).
The number of units of measure in a cord is to be squared (to get the area of the square in that measure). (Alternatively, as many units of measure there are in a cord so many rows of squares on each side will be in a square of side equal to the measuring cord.) This is the meaning.
A cord 11⁄2 puruşa long makes 21 (square purușas); a cord of 21 purușas makes 61 (square puruṣas).
Now follows the method (of finding the area of a square) when the side is increased. With the side (of the given square) and the length by which the side is increased is drawn (a rectangular area) which is placed on either side. (of the square). A square is formed with the length by which the side is increased and placed in the corner (to produce the enlarged square whose area is the sum of the given square, the two rectangles and the corner square piece).
With half the side of a square, a square one-fourth in area is produced, because four such squares to complete the area (of the original square) are produced with twice the half side. With one-third the side of a square is produced its ninth part.

The distance between the gārhapatya and the āhavanīya in the arrangement for the laying of sacrificial fires is known from the tradition. The Brāhmaṇa has to place it (the āhavanīya) (at a distance of) 8 prakramas, the prince 11 prakramas and the merchant 12 prakramas (from the garhapatya towards east).
For general use and not for any particular class, this distance is indefinite, (about) 24 prakramas to be ascertained by eye estimation and should not deviate from it much.
According to tradition, the (place of the) dakṣiņāgni is near the south-east corner of the third part of the distance of the gārhapaṭya (from the āhavaniya).
The distance between the garhapatya and the āhavaniya is divided into five or six (equal) parts, a sixth or a seventh part is added, the whole (of the cord measuring the original distance plus the added part) is divided into three (equal) parts, and a mark is given at the end of the third part from the western end. (With two ties) fastened to (poles at) the two ends of (the distance between the gārhapatya and the āhavaniya, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a pole fixed (at the point reached by the mark). This is the place of the dakṣināgni. This is according to Śruti.
The east-west line (prācî) has the measure of the sacrificer (96 angulas) or of indefinite measure like that of clarified butter in relation to fire. Such is the case with the breadth. The two amsas (shoulders) of the fire-altar are to be raised in the east and the two śroṇīs (hips) in the west. It (the altar) is shorter on the eastern side, broader on the western side and curved in the middle. It is like a wooden doll. Such is the tradition of the dārśikyā fire-altar.
To the west of the āhavanîya is constructed the four-sided elongated figure of which the length has the measure of the sacrificer (96 angulas). A cord equal to this measure is increased by itself and a mark given at the middle. With the two ties (of the cord) fastened to the (poles at the) south-western and south-eastern corners, it is stretched towards the south by the mark and a pole fixed (at the spot reached by the mark). Fixing both ends of the cord. at this pole, an arc of a circle is drawn from the south-western to the south- eastern corner (with the middle mark of the cord). The same is done on the northern side (of the fire-altar). The western and the eastern sides are to be similarly circumscribed by means of a cord double the (respective) side.

According to tradition, the saumikyā vedi measures 30 padas or prakramas on its western side, 36 (padas or prakramas) along the east-west line and 24 (padas or prakramas) on its eastern side.
To a cord of 36 (padas or prakramas) another piece of 18 (padas or prakramas) is added and a mark is given at a distance of 12 and another mark at a distance of 15 from the western end (of the cord which is added). With

ties at both ends (of the cord) fastened to (poles fixed at) two ends of the cast-west line, the cord is stretched towards the south by the mark at 15 and a pole fixed (at the point reached by the mark). The same is done towards the north. These (two points thus obtained) are the two western corners (śronis) (of the altar). After interchanging the ties at two ends, the cord is stretched (towards the south) by the mark at 15 and a pole is fixed at the mark at 12. The same is done towards the north. These are the two eastern corners (amsas) (of the altar). This is the method of construction with one cord.
The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 3 and 4 is 5. With these (sides) increased by three times themselves, the two eastern corners (of the altar), and with these (sides) increased by four times themselves, the two western corners (are determined).
The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 12 and 5 is 13. With these (sides), the two eastern corners (of the altar) and with these (sides) increased by twice them- selves, the two western corners (are determined).
The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 15 and 8 is 17. With these (sides), the two western corners (of the altar) (are determined). The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 12 and 35 is 37; with these (are fixed) the two eastern corners.
The knowledge of these (squared numbers) makes possible the construction of figures of the sacrificial altars.
The (area of the) mahāvedi is 1000 minus 28 (square) padas. From the south- east corner (a perpendicular) is dropped (on the western side) at a point 12 padas towards the south-western corner (from the east-west line). The (triangular) portion cut-off is placed invertedly on the other side. That makes a rectangle. By this addition (the area) is enumerated.
According to tradition, the sautrāmaṇikī sacrificial altar is one-third of the saumikyā vedi. (To find its dimensions), √ of a prakrama is to be substituted for prakrama (in the values given for the saumikyā). Alternatively, the trans- verse sides will be √3 times 8 and 10 and the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā) √3 times 12. The (area of the) sautrāmaṇikī sacrificial altar is 324 (square) padas.

According to tradition, the (area of the) altar for the afvamedha sacrifice is double (the area of the saumikî vedi). (Here) √/2 of a prakrama takes the place of a prakrama.
One prakrama equals 2 padas or 3 padas; on account of uncertainty in the meaning of the term (prakrama) one may take such value of prakrama as one may wish. The measure (of pada) may be that of the sacrificer or of the adhvaryu, because one directs the efforts of the other,

According to tradition, the altar for the conventional animal sacrifice (nirudhapasabandha vedi) has the measures of a chariot. There it is said that the western side (of the altar) measures 1 akṣa (104 añgulas), the east-west line 1 iṣā (188 angulas) and the eastern side 1 yuga (86 angulas) or the distance between the two outside holes.
This (is to be constructed) by the methods of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western corners are to be fixed by akṣa (52 angulas) and the eastern corners by yuga (43 angulas).
Now, these (units of chariot measure) are explained. 1 îșâ equals 188 añgulas, 1 akṣa 104 angulas and 1 yuga 36 angulas. These are according to the (Vedic) Caraṇa school and are known as chariot measures.
The western side is 4 aratnis or other measures, the east-west line 6 and the eastern side 3. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by 2 and 11⁄2 (aratnis) (respectively).
According to tradition, the paitṛkī vedi is a square, and has the measure of a sacrificer. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western and the eastern corners are fixed by half the measure.
According to the tradition of the soma sacrifice, the (side of the) uttara vedi measures 10 padas. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by half the measure.
These are measured by the yuga, pada or ŝamyā measures of the sacrificer.
One may take such value of pada, yuga, aratni and śamyā as one may wish when these (words) are used as units of measure, on account of uncertainty in the meaning of these terms.
In the measurement, the two sides should lie along the east according to tradition.

According to tradition, the sadas (shed) is 9 aratnis wide and 27 aratnis long in the south-north direction; according to some, its length is 18 aratnis. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at 15, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by 41⁄2 (aratnis).
According to tradition, the uparavas are each 1 prādeśa long, separated from one another by 1 prādeśa. A square of side equal to 1 aratni is made, poles are fixed at the (four) corners, and a circle of radius equal to half prādeśa is drawn (with each pole at the corner as centre) as per tradition.

According to tradition, the gārhapatya fire has the measure of 1 vyāyāma. It is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
1
The brick (to be used for the gårhapatya fire) is to measure | vyāyāma (32 angulas) long by ✈ vyāyāma (13 añgulas 24 tilas) wide. There are 21 such bricks (required for each layer). In the first layer, the length (of the brick) is turned towards east, and in the second layer towards north.
For the circular (gārhapatya fire), a circular mound of earth is made and a pole fixed at the middle. (With this pole as centre) a circle is drawn with (a radius equal to) | vyāyāma plus the extra (as per rule 3.2 for transforming a square into a circle). Within it (the circle) a square of the maximum size possible is drawn and divided into 9 parts (squares); each segment of the circle (between the circumference and the square) is to be divided into 3 parts.
In the placement (of bricks), the corners of square (in the first layer) point towards intermediate directions; in the other layer, these corners lie at the centres (of the segments of the first layer). (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
· The dhiṣnya fire, according to tradition, has the measure of the wooden vessel (pisilamātra); it is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
Having made a circular mound of earth, the āgnīdhriya fire is divided into 9 parts and a stone is to be placed. The other (dhiṣṇya fire) is divided into as many parts as prescribed and covered with bricks as they fit.

The tradition has it that he who constructs the fire-altar is certain to be (rich). It is constructed in the likeness of the birds, that is, after their shape, in pursuance of express direction (in the matter).
With the help of a bamboo rod of length (equal to a purușa) as mentioned, 4 (square) purușas are measured out for the body (of the fire-altar) and 1 (square) purușa is measured out for each of the southern wing, the northern wing and the tail. The southern wing is lengthened towards south by 1 aratni and likewise the northern wing towards north. The tail is lengthened towards west by 1 pradeśa or 1 vitasti.
The first agni is one-fold (11⁄2 sq. purușa); the second two-fold (21 sq. purușa); the third three-fold (31⁄2 sq. purușa) and so on; in this way one continues upto hundred-and-one-fold agni (1011 sq. purușa).
But indeed the seven-fold (agni) only is to be constructed (first); (for) the seven-fold is the proper fire-altar. Thereafter, higher altars (are obtained) by increasing the area by one (sq. purusa) successively; this is the tradition.

The one-fold and the following (fire-altars up to the six-fold) do not have wings and tails, but the seven-fold does (have them) according to the injunc- tions of the Śruti.
In the case of eight-fold and higher order fire altars, their differences in area from the seven-fold should be divided in seven and half equal parts and each part added to each purușa (of the original seven-fold altar). This is because the deformation (of the fire-altar) is disallowed in the Śruti.
According to tradition, (the term) to be measured with a puruşa means &rsquo;to be measured with a bamboo rod&rsquo;.
9
Two holes are made (at the ends of) a bamboo rod at a distance equal to the height of the sacrificer with uplifted hands, and a third hole is made at the middle. Having placed the bamboo rod along the east-west line, poles are fixed in the holes from the western extremity; two poles from the western side are then taken off, and a circle is drawn (about the pole in the eastern extremity) with the other end (from the west) towards south-east. The pole is then removed from (the hole in) the eastern extremity and fixed at the western extremity, and a circle is drawn (about the pole in the western extremity) with the other end (from the east) towards south-west. The bamboo rod is taken off and one end of it is fixed to the middle (of the east- west line) with a pole; it is then placed towards the south so as to pass over the point of intersections of the two circles and a pole is fixed in the hole at the other extremity. The bamboo rod is fixed to this (last) pole by its middle hole and laid (east-west) touching the outer edges of the two circles; two poles are fixed through the two extreme holes. This is a square of (side equal to) one purușa.
Going about in this way, four squares each of one (sq.) purușa in the body (ātman) are measured out. One (sq) purușa (is then measured out) for each of the southern wing, the tail and the northern wing. As stated, the southern wing is to be increased towards south by one aratni and so on.
A bamboo rod equal to the diagonal of a square of side one purușa is placed across from (the western end of) the east-west line and another (rod of one purușa) is placed on the east side (from the eastern end). By them (that is, by their meeting point) the south-east corner is fixed. By reversing (the place- ment of the two rods), the south-west corner is fixed. Proceeding as before, the north-east corner is fixed.
As in the case of the uttara vedi, it is measured out with the help of a cord or a bamboo rod.
When the fire-altar having wings and tail is increased to higher folds or reduced, the saptamakarani of the fold (vidha) is to be substituted by the puruşa and the area (of the fire-altar) drawn.TRANSLATION

Of the bricks, the side (of the first type) should measure one-fifth of a purușa ; the second type has one of its sides longer by half; the third type is one-fifth of a purușa long and one prādesa broad; bricks with each side equal to one prādeśa form the fourth type; square bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purușa) constitute the fifth type.
The height of the brick is to be made a fifth of the jānu and that of the nākasat and pañcacoḍā half of that measure.
What is lost by burning (and drying) is to be made good by loose earth because of the flexibility of its quality.

In the placement (of bricks), 10 bricks longer by half (that is, 36 ang×24 ang) and turned towards west are placed on the east side of the body (ātman); 10 (of them) turned towards east on the west side (of the body); 5 (of them) at each end of the two wings; 5 (of them) at both junctions of the wings (with the body) such that half of the bricks (that is, the added half 12 ang of the adhyardhā) lie in the wings; and 5 bricks turned towards north and south on both sides of the tail.
After placing bricks of side equal to 1 prādeŝa in the tail, all the (remaining) space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a puruşa).
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purusa).
In the other layer, 10 bricks longer by half and turned towards north are placed on the south side of the body and 10 (of them) turned towards south on the north side (of the body). (The placement of bricks) in the tail will be the same as in the wings for the first layer and that in the wings the same as in the tail (for the first layer). In the junction (between the tail and the body), (the placement of bricks should be) in the reverse order.
The whole (of the remaining) space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa).
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purușa). (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
There are five layers; these are covered with five (layers of) loose earth, ending up with a layer of earth; (this is done) for various purposes (served by) loose earth.
10.8 The construction of the fire-altar for the first time should be with 1000 bricks upto (the height of) the knee; for the second time with 2000 bricks upto (the height of) the navel; for the third time with 3000 bricks upto (a height of) the mouth; and so on upto higher and higher heights. Those who
110
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASÚTRA
desire heaven should construct by increasing the height measure with innumerable bricks; this is the tradition.
10.9 In the case of (fire-altars employing) 2000 bricks, the piles will be two layered; in the case of 3000 bricks, three layered; in the case of 4000 and larger number of bricks, the number of bricks (for the layer) remains the same (as that for the 3000).
10.10 According to tradition, a smaller fire-altar should not be laid after a larger
one has been constructed.
11.1
11.2
11
According to tradition, the fire-altar is to be constructed with four sided (bricks); in the absence of anything mentioned in particular, a square is to be understood.
(The bricks should be) of the measure of pada, aratni, urvasthi and aṇuka; this is the tradition.
11.3 anūka is one-fourth (of a purușa), aratni one-fifth (of a purușa), and so is ūrvasthi
(one-sixth of a purușa).
11.4
11.5
11.6
The quarter bricks have the measure of a păda; there one is free to choose owing to the wide range of the meaning of the word (pada).
In the placement (of bricks), 8 bricks of size quarter of the one-fourth (that is, 15 x 15 sq. ang.) are to be placed at each end of the two wings and 8 similar bricks at the (two) junctures (between the wing and the body) such that 6 angulas (of the bricks) lie within the body. 8 bricks (of the same type) are placed on the western corners (of the body, 4 on each, lined) towards east and 8 bricks on the eastern corner towards west.
In the space (of the body) between the two junctures (with the wings), bricks of size one-fifth (of a purusa) and their quarters (are placed).
11.7 After placing bricks of size equal to 1 prādeśa in the tail, the whole of the
(remaining space of the) fire-altar is to be covered with one-fourth bricks.
11.8 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks.
11.9
In the other layer, one-fifth bricks are placed in the middle of the juncture of the tail (with the body). 14 bricks of size quarter of them (of one-fifth, that is, 12 x 12 sq. ang.) are placed around in the body as they fit.
11.10 The whole of the (remaining) fire-altar is to be covered with one-fifth bricks. 11.11 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks. (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
12
12.1 For one-fold etc. (upto the six-fold fire-altar), square bricks of side equal to one-twelfth and one-thirteenth of the side (of the fire-altar) are to be made

111
as also their quarters. (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
From one-fold etc. (upto the six-fold), bricks are used in the first, second and third construction; in all cases and also for higher constructions, their number is according to the prescription of the Śruti (that is, 1000 bricks for all constructions).
12.3 The kamya (fire-altars) are (endowed with) different merits and (are prescribed for the fulfilment of special desires) according to the science of merits (guṇaśāstra).
12.4 Those who have many foes should construct a (fire-altar in the form of an
isosceles) triangle; this is the tradition.
12.5 A square twice as large as the area of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is laid; the mid-point of the eastern side (of the square) is joined to the two western corners (of the square, and the area lying outside these lines is cut off); this is the exact triangle (equal in area to the seven-fold fire-altars of 71⁄2 sq. puruṣa).
12.6 Bricks are to be made as in the case of one-fold etc. fire-altars (that is, of side equal to one-twelfth and one-thirteenth of the side of the altar); these should have the shape of an isosceles triangle.
12.7 According to tradition, those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus (made of two isosceles triangles, ubhayata prauga).
12.8
This (rhombus) looks like two inverted (fore parts) of a cart (joined together). As in the case (of the isosceles triangle), a rectangle (twice the area of 7 sq. purușa) is constructed and the mid-points of the eastern and western sides are joined to the mid-points of the southern and northern sides (of the rectangle, and the area lying outside these lines is cut off); this is the exact rhombus. (Bricks for this fire-altars are to be made in the same manner) as described in the case of the isosceles fire-altars.
12.9 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel is to be
constructed (when it is desired) to destroy enemies.
12.10 A circle of area equal to that of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is made and the largest possible square is inscribed in it.
13
13.1
13.2
Bricks (for the construction of the chariot wheel fire-altar) are made with the twelfth part of the side (of the inscribed square).
6 of these (bricks) are placed in each circular segment and the remaining space (of the segment) is divided into 8 parts.
112

ĀPASTAMBA-SULBASŪTRA
In the placement (of the first layer), the corners of the square should lie in the intermediate directions and in the other layer in the centres of the segments (of the first layer). (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
According to tradition, those who desired food should construct a fire-altar in the form of a trough.
The troughs are indeed of two types, e.g. the square-shaped and the circular. One can construct the fire-altar of any one of these (two) types as one may wish.
13.7 Rather from considerations of quality a square (dronacit) should be cons-
tructed.
13.8 According to tradition, the handle (of the trough) should lie on (its) western
side.
13.9 The area of the handle is one-tenth of the total area (of the fire-altar). This being placed in the form of the tail (separate from the body), the area (of the square body) is found by the difference (of two squares) as already stated.
13.10 The (square) bricks are to be made with the twelfth part of the side (of the square body). Bricks longer by half (adhyardhā) and quarter bricks are also made.
13.11 In the placement (of the bricks in the first layer), the bricks longer by half are arranged on the eastern side of the body, turned towards west, at the (west) end of the handle and at the two western corners (of the body).
13.12 The remaining space of the fire-altar is covered with square bricks.
13.13 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks.
13.14 In the other layer, the bricks longer by half are placed along the southern side of the body, turned towards north and along the northern side, turned towards south; the same is done along the southern and the northern side of the handle.
13.15 The remaining space of the fire-altar is covered with square bricks.
13.16 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks. (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.

Those who desire beasts should construct the samahya, according to
tradition.
Bricks are to be placed all around the samūhya (fire-altar).
14.3 The catvāla pits (in the ground) are to be placed in every direction.
and levelled with clay with water (purîșa); this is the tradition.

14.4
14.5
Those who desire villages should construct the paricayya (fire-altar); this is the tradition.
The paricayya is that (fire-altar) in which bricks are placed around the central svayamātṛṇṇā (brick).
14.6 According to tradition, the upacayya is to be constructed by those who desire villages. It is prepared in a manner opposite to that of the paricāyya (that is, the construction proceeds from outside to the centre).
14.7
14.8
14.9
Those who desire prosperity in the abode of the Fathers should construct the fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit); this is the tradition.
The pyres are indeed of two types, e.g. the square-shaped and the circular.
One can construct the fire-altar of any one of these (two) types as one may wish.
14.10 Rather from considerations of quality a square (śmaśānacit) should be cons- tructed. In the square type, it should be like the trough without the handle, as already stated.
14.11 According to tradition, those who desire beasts should construct the fire-
altar with the meters (in place of bricks).
14.12 According to one opinion, the entire (sacrificial ceremony) should be per- formed by means of meters, according to another, by the usual sacrificial fires.

15.4
Those who desire heaven should construct a fire-altar in the shape of a falcon; this is the tradition.
This (fire-altar) has curved wings and extended tail. The west side (of first half of the wing) is pushed upwards towards east and the east side (of the wing from the middle to the end) is pushed downwards towards west. In this way the wings of birds are said to be bent at their middle (part).
The (area of the) fire-altar is to be made seven-fold with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa. (Of the rectilinear syenacit), the prādeśa (portion of the tail) and the fourth part of the body (atman) together with 8 caturbhāgīyās (also from the body) (are to be taken out). Out of these (areas), three (caturbh- āgiyās) form the head (of the falcon) and the remaining (area) is to be distributed between the two wings.
5 aratnis make 1 purușa, 4 aratnis 1 vyāyāma, 24 añgulas 1 aratni and half (of 24 añgulas, that is, 12 añgulas) 1 prādeśa. That is the definition.
15.5
The length of the wing is 9 aratnis and angulas.
114
15.6
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASŪTRA
A tie is made at either end of a cord 2 purușas long and a mark given at the middle (of the cord). Having fastened the ties at the two western corners of the (southern) wing, the cord is stretched towards east by the mark; the same is done on the eastern side (of the wing). This makes the bending (of the wing). Thereby is explained (the bending of) the northern wing.
15.7 The body is 2 purușas long and 11⁄2 purușas broad.
15.8
15.9
At the place of the tail, a rectangle puruşa broad and 1 purușa long towards west is constructed; a similar rectangle is constructed on its southern and northern side. These (latter, i.e. the southern and the northern) two (rectangles) are diagonally cut off such that the length (of the tail) at its juncture (with the body) is purușa.
At the place of the head, a square of side purușa is drawn; the mid-point of its eastern side is joined to the mid-points of the southern and the northern sides (and the parts lying outside these lines are cut off).
16
16.1
16.2
The western and the eastern corners (of the body) are cut off (by lines) in the direction of the junctures (of the body with the tail and the head). This is the (form) of the falcon.
Bricks are made with length equal to one-fifth purușa (24 añg) and breadth one-sixth purușa (20 ang.), the two sides being inclined (with each other) in such a way that these fit (with the shape of the wing). This is the first type.
16.3 Two of these (first type) bricks are joined along the east line (that is, the
length). This is the second type.
16.4
16.5
16.6
That side of the first type, which is one-sixth purușa long is extended by one- eighth of a purușa (15 añg), and (the extended part) is bent so as to fit (with the shape of the fire-altar). This is the third type.
A (square) brick of side one-fourth of a purușa (30 ang) is lengthened by half; the (square) portion of side one-fourth purușa is diagonally cut off. This is the fourth type.
The fifth type of brick is half of the (square) brick of side one-fourth of a purusa.
16.7 By dividing it (the fifth type) by the diagonal, the sixth type (is obtained).
16.8
A rectangle of breadth one-tenth of a purușa (12 ang) and length one-fifth of a purușa (24 añg) in the direction from east to west is drawn. One each such rectangle is placed on its southern and its northern side. These two (latter, that is, the southern and the northern, rectangles) are cut off by diagonals passing through their south-west corners. This is the seventh type.
TRANSLATION
115
16.9 Like-wise another type is formed in which the northern rectangle is cut off by the diagonal passing through the north (-western) corner (the cutting off of the southern rectangle being as before). This is the eighth type.
16.10 The ninth type is obtained by dividing by both diagonals a (square) brick
of side one-fourth of a purușa.
16.11 In the placement (of bricks in the first layer) 60 bricks of the first type turned
towards north, are placed in each wing.
16.12 Along each side of the tail, 8 bricks of the sixth type are placed (in this way); three of them at the end (of the tail) and one above them and again three and one (above them).
16.13 At the juncture of the tail (with the body), 2 bricks of the fourth type partly covering both (the tail and the body) are placed. West of them (are placed) 2 bricks of the fifth class touching each other edge to edge.
17.1
17.2
17.3
17
The remaining space (of the tail) is covered by 10 bricks of the fourth type. 8 bricks of this type, turned towards east and west, are placed in the four corners (of the body).
The remaining space (of the body) is covered by 26 bricks of the fourth, 8 of the sixth and 4 of the fifth type.
In the head 2 bricks of the fourth type partly covering both (the head and the body) are placed and 2 of the same type, turned towards east, above them.
17.4 Thus is formed the (first) layer of 200 bricks.
17.5
17.6
17.7
17.8
In the other layer, 5 bricks of the second type are to be placed at each of the two bendings (of the two wings). At either juncture (of the wing with the body) (5) bricks of the third type are placed in such a way that the portion of each brick extended by one-eighth puruşa lies within the body. The remain- ing space (of each wing) is covered by 45 bricks of the first type, turned towards east.
5 bricks of the seventh type are placed along each of the two sides of the tail. Next to such brick in the second row on one side and in the fourth row on the other side, one brick each of the seventh type is to be placed. The remaining space (of the tail) is to be covered by 13 bricks of the eighth type.
8 bricks of the fourth type, turned towards south and north, are placed in the western and the eastern corners (of the body). The remaining space (of the body) is covered by 20 bricks of the fourth type, 30 bricks of the sixth and 1 brick of the fifth type.
In the head are placed 2 bricks of the fourth type and east of them 4 bricks of the ninth type.
116
ĀPASTAMBA-SULBASŪTRA
17.9 Thus is formed the (second) layer of 200 bricks.
17.10 (With these two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired

Those who desire heaven should construct a fire-altar in the shape of a falcon; this is the tradition.
18.2 This (fire-altar) has curved wings and extended tail. The west side (of first half of the wing) is pushed upwards towards east and the east side (of the wing from the middle to the end) is pushed downwards towards west. In this way the wings of birds are said to be bent at their middle (part).
120 (square) bricks each of a (square) purușa (side, † pu. or 30 ang) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. pu.) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa. Of them, 40 (can be accommodated) in the body (ātman), 3 in the head, 15 in the tail, 31 in the southern wing and the same (number) in the northern (wing).
18.3
18.4
18.5
A rectangle, 11⁄2 purușa broad and 2 purușas long, is constructed. (An area equal to) 2 bricks of th (square purușa) is discarded from each of the two western and the eastern corners, leaving (an area equivalent of) 40 (sodasi) bricks. This is the body.
At the place of the head, a square of side purușa is drawn; the mid-point of its eastern side is joined to the mid-points of the southern and the northern sides (and the parts lying outside these lines are cut off). (An area equivalent of) 3 (ṣoḍaśi) bricks is left. This is the head.
1
18.6 A rectangle of breadth 1 puruşa and length 2 purusas, further extended by an area of square puruşa makes the southern wing. Likewise (is made) the northern wing.
18.7
18.8
At the end of (each) wing, 4 squares of side equal to † of a purușa are made, diagonally divided, and their halves discarded. An area (equivalent of) 31 (ṣoḍaśī) bricks is left.
In the middle of the wing less the end portion (that is purușa or 30 ang with which the 4 squares were made), an east-west line is drawn. From (the western point of) the juncture of the wing (with the body) a cord of length 1 purușa is stretched and a point at the end of 1 purușa is given (where the end of the cord meets the east-west line). At a distance of 1 puruşa from this point towards east another point is given. From these two points lines are to be drawn to the different end points (of the wing at the junction with the body and at the end less puruşa where the 4 squares were made). This is the curving of the (southern) wing. Thus is explained (the curving of) the northern wing.

(An area bounded by a length of) 2 purușas on the western side, 1⁄2 puruşa on the eastern side, √/18 (times ‡ purușa or 30 ang) on each of the two (southern and northern) sides and having a height of puruşa can accommodate 15 (ṣoḍaśi) bricks. This is the tail.
19.2 The one-sixteenth (ṣoḍaśī) brick is to be bounded by four sides (whose
measures are) : † purușa, § purușa, ‡ purușa and √ purușa.

middle of the wing (pakṣamadhyāyā) is bounded by four
puruşa each and the other two by purușa each.
A brick for use at the end of the wing (pakṣāgrīyā) is bounded by three sides, -one side by purușa, one side by (+7) purușa, and the remaining side by ( √ + 4) purușa.
For making the brick for use in the wing (pakṣeṣṭakā) a rectangle of breadth puruşa and length puruşa is made and then lengthened by a diagonal (so that the other diagonal is shortened and the figure assumes the form of a parallelogram). The slabs are bent by the seventh of the distance between the root (apyaya) and the bending point of the wing (pakṣanamanī).
In the placement (of bricks), 4 quarter bricks are placed in the east of the head, 5 on the western side of the juncture of the head (with the body), 11 on the eastern side of the (eastern) juncture of the wings (with the body), 11 on the western side of the (western) juncture of the wings (with the body), 5 on the eastern side of the juncture of the tail (with the body) and 5 on the west of it, and 15 at the end of the tail.
20
4 bricks for use at the end of the wing (pakṣāgriyā) are each placed at the end of the two wings and 4 at the juncture of the wing (with the body) each lying partly in both (the wing and the body).
Around these latter (pakṣāgrīyā bricks partly lying) in the body, 4 one- sixteenth bricks are placed on either side as these fit.
4 bricks for use in the middle of the wing (pakṣamadhyiyā) are each placed in the middle of the two wings. The two wings are (then) to be covered by

bricks for use in the wings (pakṣeṣṭakā), (the longer sides of the bricks being) turned towards east.
The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be covered with one-sixteenth bricks; at the (inclined) edges (of the fire-altar) the diagonal sides (of these bricks) are to face outwards; elsewhere. (their placement should be) as in the head.
In the other layer, 2 one-sixteenth bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards are to be placed in the east of the head; west of them two of these with their diagonal sides facing inwards (are to be placed) partly covering the head and the body.
2 half bricks are to be placed as these fit, and these are to be enclosed by 2 half bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards.
One-sixteenth bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards are to be placed where the sides of the body meet (that is, at the western and eastern corners).
4 half bricks (are to be placed) at each end of the two wings. Two wings are (then) to be covered with bricks for use in the wings (pakṣeṣṭakā), (their longer sides) turned towards north.
20.9 3 half bricks (are to be placed) at either side of the tail.
20.10 The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be covered with one-sixteenth bricks; at the (inclined) edges (of the fire-altar) the diagonal sides are to face outwards, elsewhere (their placement should be) as in the tail.
20.11 If square or triangular areas arise (due to the removal of ṣoḍaśī bricks for completing the number 200), these are to be covered by half or quarter bricks. Aņukās in the place of pañcadaśabhāgījās (are to be placed).
20.12 (With these two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired
are to be constructed.

21.1 The kite-shaped fire-altar (kankacit) and the fire-altar in the form of an alaja
bird are explained after the falcon-shaped (fire-altar).
21.2
21.3
Like the falcon their two wings are larger than the tail and more curved (at the middle); the inclined tail is long (at the end and short where it joins with the body); neither the body nor the head is circular. This is according to the scriptures. Or, in pursuance of the sacred tradition, (the fire-altar may be) without the head.
And it is taught thus: &lsquo;One who wishes to live with the head on in this world should provide the kankacit with the head&rsquo;. Why is it said when one (always) has (the head)?TRANSLATION
119
21.4 Naturally the two wings are curved and the tail is narrowed because such modifications are so heard. Where no (such) modification is heard, the body retains its natural form.
21.5
Thus it is constructed in the form of the falcon, and the shape has been explained after the sacred tradition.
21.6 According to tradition, the fire-altar for the afvamedha (sacrifice) is three
times as large (as the seven-fold with aratni and prādeśa).
21.7
All (sorts of) enlargements are possible in this case as nothing particular is mentioned.
21.8 The enlargement of the wings and the tail is stated to be brought about by
the addition of rectangles.
21.9
It is (further) taught that, for the aśvamedha sacrifice, the fire-altar is of twenty-one.</p>
