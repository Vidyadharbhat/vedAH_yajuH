  <p>CHAPTER 1
CONSTRUCTION OF SQUARE, THE THEOREM OF SQUARE ON THE
DIAGONAL AND THE VALUE OF √2
Apastamba summarized the knowledge of geometry and related problems in the first three chapters. The first chapter deals with various methods of construction of square, the theorem of square on the diagonal of a square and rectangle, and the calculation of the value of √2.
1.2-1.3. Construction of a square. Two methods of construction of a square are discussed here. These rules are essentially the same as those of Baudhāyana (Bśl. 1.8 and 1.5).
1.4-1.5. Theorem of square on the diagonal. The rule says, AB2 + BC2
AC2, where AB and BC are the sides of a rectangle ABCD. We have discussed this sūtra in detail under B§l. 1.12 and 1.13. Only the last line of Ã§l. 1.4, which contains the term tābhirjñeyabhi requires to be explained. According to Bürka, &ldquo;the construction (found in Ãśl. 1.2 and 1.3) has been taught by means of (the application of) these (akṣṇayārajju, pārśvamānī and tiryaṁmāni of a rectangle), of course, by means of such as are recognizable (i.e. which can be expressed in recognizable numbers).” jñā means &rsquo;to know&rsquo;. Various terms like jñātumsakti, iti vijñāyate, tābhirjñeyābhi have been used by the sulbakāras. According to Datta &ldquo;, these can be interpreted as &ldquo;known from the ancient scriptures&rdquo;.
The sūtra Āśl. 2.5, undoubtedly a special case of Ãśl. 2.4, defines the diagonal of a square a as dvikarāņi or √ē a. This has been discussed in Bśl. 1.9-1.11.
1.6. Value of √2. Extactly the same sūtra of Baudhāyana for the value of √2 is given here by Apastamba. This has been discussed under Bśl. 2.12.
1.7. Construction of a square. This sūtra describes another method of construction of a square, not given by Baudhāyana. In Fig. 1, XY represents the given cord. T, U,V are marks at the middle of the cord XY, and of XT and TV respectively. EF is the east-west line. E, M, O, N, F are poles corresponding to X, U, T, V and Y. K represents the sign corresponding to T when the cord Xr is stretched after the ends X and Y are fixed at M and N. The mark S corresponding to T is

As in the dronacit, there are four segments. 6 one-twelfth bricks are placed in the middle of the segment in contact with the inscribed square and the remaining space is divided into 7 parts as shown in the Fig. 75. The breadth of the brick in the centre of the segment (pradhi-madhyamā) in between the square bricks and the circumference must be 1 prakrama or 30 ang. as in the dronacit.

Fig. 75. Arrangement of bricks in the circular kürmacit,–
(a) 1st layer; (b) 2nd layer.
In the first layer, there are 144 square bricks inside the inscribed square, 24 square bricks in the segments and 28 bricks of different types in the remaining space of the pradhi. This makes 196 bricks. Now the pradhi-madhyama is pushed into the head and the vacant space thus created is filled with 2 bricks. The four feet are filled with 8 bricks of two types obtained in the process of cutting the ṣoḍaśi square bricks by the circle of the body as referred to before. The total now becomes 206, that is, 6 bricks in excess of the required number of 200. This is adjusted by replacing 18 square bricks by 12 1 square bricks. (aṣṭādaŝa caturaśra uddhṛtya dvādaśādhyardheṣṭakā upadadhyāt).
In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned so that its four corners now point towards east, south, west and north. The placing of the bricks is the same as in the first layer with the difference that the placement of bricks in the feet is as in the case of the head of the first layer and that in the head as in the feet of the first layer. The adjustment is made as before.
The remaining sūtras 21.10-21.13 do not call for much comment.

Similarly, the other corner points A, B, C are obtained. Hence ABCD is the required square.
CHAPTER 2
CONSTRUCTION OF SQUARE, SURD, A SQUARE FROM A COMBINA- TION AND DIFFERENCE OF TWO SQUARES, AND TRANSFORMATION
OF A RECTANGLE INTO A SQUARE
This chapter mainly deals with the methods of construction and transformation of geometrical figures like square and rectangle, already dealt by Baudhāyana.
2.1. Construction of a square. Apastamba des- cribes here an interesting method of cons- truction of a square. In Fig. 2, EW represents the east-west line, 2a; XU the given cord, a; XV the saviśeșa of a, √2a; and Vr the half cord, a.
The cord XY is prepared for its use in the construction of the square.

The knots at X and Y are tied at ◊ and E respectively and the cord is stretched by the mark V, which gives the south-east corner D. Then the knot at E is taken off and fixed at W. The cord is likewise stretched by the mark V, which fixes the south-western corner C. The process is repeated in the north-eastern and the north-western side. ABCD is the required construction of the square.
2.2-2.3. Surd. Dvikaraņi means √2 a, where a is the measure; likewise tṛkaraņi is √3a,
1
and tṛtiyakaraṇi = √3 a. For details vide our discussion under Bśl. 1.9-1.11.
2.4-2.6. Āpastamba&rsquo;s methods for making a square out of a combination or differ- ence of two squares are exactly the same as those of Baudhāyana, discussed in B§l. 2.1-2.2. The sūtra Āśl. 2.6 is an application of the combination of two squares, for instance a2 + 3a2 4a2, where a is the measure or producer of the square.
2.7. The same method of transformation of a rectangle into a square as given by Baudhayana in his Bŝl. 2.5 is discussed.

TRANSFORMATION OF A SQUARE INTO A RECTANGLE AND A CIRCLE, OF A CIRCLE INTO A SQUARE, AND CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS ENLARGEMENT OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENT MEASURES FOR SURFACE MEASUREMENTS
The chapter deals with the transformation of squares into rectangles and circles, and of circles into squares. The methods given are the same as those by Baudhāyana. Moreover, Apastamba has given an idea of surface measures and methods of enlargement or construction of different squares.
3.1-3.2. Square into a rectangle and circle. The sūtra Ãśl. 3.1 describes the method of transformation of a square into a rectangle. This has been discussed in detail under Bśl. 2.3-2.4. The methods of transformation from square into a circle given in Asl. 3.2 and B§l. 2.9 are exactly the same; for discussion, vide B§l. 2.9.
3.3. Circle into a square. This is the same as that of Bśl. 2.10-2.11 (second method).
3.4-3.10. Squares of different measures and enlargement of areas. One unit in length produces one square unit area; two units produce four square areas, and three units nine square areas, and so on. Pramāṇamātreṇa daṇḍena pramāṇamātram kṣetram vidhi- yate | dvipramāṇena daṇḍena catvāri pramāṇakṣetrāni bhavanti (Sundararāja)a. The sutra Asl. 3.7 explains that if ABCD be a square of p units, it produces p2 unit squares. If ABCD be a rectangle whose length AB has p units and breadth BC q units, then ABCD contains pq unit square areas (Fig. 3). According to Kapardib : yāvatpramāṇa yāvadāyāmā rajjuḥ tāvato vargānkaroti pańkti karoti | yāvat saṇkhyā yuktam pramāņaṁ tāvat samkhyāyuktaḥ pańktiḥ karoti | pañcamānam pañcasaṇkhyā yuktānvargān karoti | This has been beautifully explained by Karavinda as follows: dvipramāṇapārśvamānikam- ekapramāṇatiryaṁmāniyakam dvidha&rsquo; pacchidya dve upalabhyete | dvipramāņa pārśvamānikam tripramāṇa tiryanmānīkam prāk dvidhodak tridha&rsquo; pacchidya şaḍupalabhyante / This result

6.1. Aśvamedha vedi. Āpastamba has given hints to the construction of similar isosceles trapezium of area 1944 sq. padas for the aśvamedha vedi. Its area equals 36√2 × § (24 √2 + 30√2) or 1944 sq. padas: This is double of the size of the mahāvedi. Hence, for an isosceles trapezium of n times the size of the mahāvedi, n being an integer or a fraction, only the unit of measurement of the latter should be replaced by Vn times the side of the mahāvedi.
6.2. The unit of prakrama has been discussed (Bśl. 4.12-4.14) and Aśl. 5.7). Four officiating priests are usually required for the sacrifice, namely, adhvaryu, hotṛ, brāhmaṇa and the āgnidhriya. The adhvaryua should sweep the ground of altars three times and trace out the drawing with the help of the wooden sword.

272 + (11)2= (291)2
The sada is also a rectangle of length 18 aratnis and breadth 10 prakramas (Bśl. 4.1 ff) where relation, 182 + (7)2 = (191), holds good. For uparavas, vide Bŝl. 4.1.-4.2.

For the construction of a fire-altar of 81 or more sq. purusas, Āpastamba has followed the same rule as given by Baudhāyana (vide Bśl. 5.1-5.6) for proportionate increment of square purușas from the agni of 7 sq. purusas.
9.1-9.5. Construction of square. Here two methods of drawing a square required for the construction of the body (ātmā) of caturaśraśyenacit are described. The first method is explained in Fig. 7.

Four such squares each of 1 sq. purușa form the body (ātmā) of the caturaśraśyenacit. How any increment to the area of more than 7 fold agni is to be effected has already been discussed in Bśl. 5.1-5.6.
9.6. Bricks of caturaśraśyenacit. Five kinds of bricks used for the caturaśraśyenacit are described as follows:
242
ĀPASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA
pañcami, square bricks of side one-fifth of a purusa, 24 ang. × 24 ang. ; adhyardha, rectangular brick, 36 ang. x 24 ang. ;
ardhyā, a rectangular half of pañcami, 24 ang. × 12 ang. ;
caturbhāgiyā, a square brick one fourth of pañcami, 12 ang. × 12 ang.
pañcadaśabhāgiyā, a square brick of side one-fifteenth of a purușa 8 ang. × 8 ang. The heights of bricks in most cases are the same with the exception of the nāka- sada and pañcacoḍā bricks, which have the height of the normal bricks used for altar construction. The pañcacoḍā and nākasada bricks are usually used at the top (vide Bśl. 5.7-7.3).
CHAPTER 10
CONSTRUCTION OF A RECTILINEAR SYENACIT
10.1-10.3. The method of arranging bricks of size one-fifth of a purușa and those derived from them in a rectilinear syenacit is described in this chapter. The first three sūtras indicate the procedure for the first layer. The bricks to be used and already described in 9.6 are:

COMMENTARY

The arrangement of bricks is shown in Fig. 9 The adhyardă-pañcami (B2) bricks at each juncture of the wing with the body are placed such that 24 angulas lie within the body and 12 angulas in the wing, as explained by the commentators (ātmānama- ratninā prādesena pakṣamityarthaḥ-Karavinda). In the tail, the B2 bricks on each side may start from the upper end at the junction with the body, leaving 12 angulas (prādeśakṣetra) at the end, as it appears from Sundararāja, or from the western end of the tail leaving the prādeśakṣetra adjacent to the body, as is preferred by Karavinda. Both Sundararāja and Karavinda place 2 B1 bricks at each end of the prādeśakṣetra and 4 Bs in the middle (Fig. 9(a)). Kapardi places 2 B2s in the middle flanked on each side by 3 B1s (Fig. 9(b)). In the former arrangement, the number of bricks total 166, and in the latter 168, as detailed in Table I.

For 166 bricks, the deficit is 34. Sundararaja proposes to replace 4 B1s from the middle of the body by 36 Bs and again 2 B1s from the end of the tail by 4 Bös.

10:4-10.6. In describing the arrangement of bricks in the second layer in these sūtras, care is taken that the edges of bricks in the two layers do not meet. This is achieved by placing 10 B2 bricks turned towards north or south along the southern and the northern side of the body and interchanging the arrangement of bricks between the tail and the wing. Thus B, bricks placed at the juncture between the wing and the body in the first layer are now placed at that between the tail and the body, with 1 aratni or 24 angulas lying within the tail and 12 angulas within the body. (tāsāmardheṣṭakāmātrāṇyātmani bhavanti/pucche&rsquo;ratnimātrāņi/Sundararāja.). Since 12 angulas of these bricks project into the body, these are covered, according to the commentators, by 5 Bgs to enable the filling up of the remaining space with B1s. In the first layer, 5 B2s lined each side of the tail. This arrangement is to be followed in the case of the wings for the second layer with the modification that on each side of the wing the number of B2s should now be 6 because of the extension of the wing by one aratni. The different types of bricks arranged in the above manner total 163, as mentioned by Karavinda and in Fig. 10 and Table 2.

Now, 37 bricks are still required to make the number 200. According to Kara- vinda, 4 B1s, one each from the body, the wings and the tail, are replaced by 36 B¿s; 5 B1s in the middle of the easternmost row in the body are replaced by 10 B ̧s.

CONSTRUCTION OF A RECTILINEAR SYENACIT WITH SQUARE
BRICKS
11.1-11.4. In this chapter, another method of constructing a rectilinear syenacit is described, in which only square bricks are employed. These bricks are :

aņuka means one-fourth of a purușa, i.e. 30 añgulas; aratni has already been explained; urvasthi stands for one-sixth of a purușa, i.e. 20 añgulas (puruṣasya ṣaṣtḥo bhāga ūrvasthi- Karavinda). pāda is a quarter; by using it with bricks of size one-fourth, one-fifth etc. of a purușa, their quarter bricks are indicated.
11.5-11.8. The plan of placing bricks in the first layer is shown in Fig. 11. The number of bricks used in different parts of the fire-altar, as per explanations of the commentators, are shown in Table 3.

The direction for the placement of 8 B bricks on each of the two ends of the wings and at their junctions with the body is clear. About the four corners of the body, the commentators explain that 4 B1s should be placed at each along west-east or east-west. At the junctures, these bricks lie 6 angulas within the body, leaving a rectangular space 228 × 120 ang2 in the body (sandhāntarāla) to be filled by B2 bricks and their quarters, B5. Clearly, there can be only 9 rows of 5 B2 bricks each, Table 3. Bricks in different parts of the citi, first layer; following Kapardisvāmi, Karavindasvāmi and Sundararāja

leaving a rectangular strip which can be fitted by 10 B, bricks only. According to Kapardi and Karavinda, the B, row is to be so placed that there are 25 B2s south of it and 20 Bs north of it (as shown in Fig. 11). (tāsam dakṣiṇataḥ pañcavimśatiḥ pañcamabhāgiyāḥ | uttarato viṛśatiḥ (). Sundararāja prescribes the opposite, saying that the other arrangement is also permissible. The remaining space in each wing can be filled by 16 B1s and that in the body by 28 B1s.
As regards the tail, the direction in the sutra being insufficient, the commentators have suggested different arrangements. Kapardi places 4 B,s on each side at the western corner of the tail, 13 B2s in between and above and 8 B1s in the remaining eastern part of the tail (Fig. 11 (a)). Karavinda divides the tail in two parts filling the western part by 15 B2s and the eastern by 8 B1s (Fig. 11(b)). Sundararāja takes prādeśa to mean prādeśakṣetra, which can be filled by 10 В5s (pucchāgre yatpravṛddham prādeśakṣetram tadupadadhyāt sāmarthyāddaśabhiḥ prādeśaḥ(); the remaining space is filled by 16 B1s. The last one appears to be straightforward.
1
To complete the number 200, Sundararāja&rsquo;s arrangement shows a deficit of 11 bricks. From the western half of the tail 2 B1s (one from each side) are replaced by 8 Bs; in the eastern half, 4 B1s in the middle are substituted by 9 Bgs. Karavinda&rsquo;s deficit of 14 bricks is met in the following way: 1 B1 in the body immediately above the fifth row of bricks (in the sandhāntarāla) is replaced by 9 quarter B, bricks (that is, 10 × 10 ang2); 2 B2s, one each from the western corners of the tail, are replaced by 8 Bs. Kapardi&rsquo;s deficit of 8 bricks can be met by replacing 1 B1 by 9 quarter B2s, as in the case of Karavinda..
2
11.9-11.11. In the arrangement of bricks in the second layer, 5 B2 bricks are placed at the juncture between the tail and the body, half of them lying on either side. 14 Bgs are placed around the aforesaid bricks, 10 east of them and 2 on each side. The remaining space in the body can be filled with 94 bricks, thus accounting for 113 bricks in the body with the junction, of which B2s are 99 and Bs are 14. In each wing 30 Bs are placed, so that there are 60 bricks in the two wings. In the tail, following Karavinda, 9 B, bricks are placed in the upper half immediately after the junction bricks, in three rows,-two on the sides and one in the middle.

In this way 194 bricks are accounted for. To complete the number of 200 bricks, the following adjustments are proposed by the commentators. There are 10 rows, south-north, in the body, including bricks at the juncture. 10 B,s in each of the 2nd and the 9th row are replaced by 8 B1s each and 10 B2s in the 6th by 20 B¿s, with a gain of 6 bricks to make up the deficit. The arrangement of bricks with these adjustments is shown in Fig. 12 and their distribution over various parts in Table 4.
CHAPTER 12
FIRE-ALTARS OF AREAS ONE-FOLD AND UPWARDS, AND FIRE- ALTARS IN THE FORM OF ISOSCELES TRIANGLE, RHOMBUS AND
CHARIOT WHEEL
12.1. The side of an one-fold fire-altar of area 1 sq.pu. is 120 ang; that of a six-fold fire-altar is 293 ang 31 tilas. Baudhāyana (Bśl. 5.8-5.15) has discussed the question of fire-altars smaller than 7 sq. pu.. Here it is maintained that no fire-altar smaller than the seven-fold should be used, although some teachers uphold the legitimacy of fire-altars from 1 to 6 sq. pu. Such smaller fire-altars may be constructed but then only in the form of praugas, rathacakras etc.
12.3. The kamyas (desires) are different forms of the seven-fold fire-altar. Guņas (qualities) are six in number (Karavinda). For guṇavikāra see Āśr. 14.1, 1).
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM Of an Isosceles TRIANGLE (PRAUGACITI) 12.4-12.6. The fire-altars in the form of isosceles triangles (prauga) are discussed in these sutras. The prauga has been likened to the fore part of a cart (śakaṭa-mukha). The method of transforming a square (or a rectangle) into an isosceles triangle has been discussed by Baudhayana (Bśl. 1.7). The construction of a fire-altar in the form of an isosceles triangle and the various types of bricks employed are fully discussed in Bśl. 14.1-14.8. Baudhāyana advises the use of rectangular bṛhatî bricks and their triangular halves and quarters by cutting the bṛhatis diagonally.
248
APASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA
Apastamba advises the use of isosceles triangular bricks of different sizes, as explained by his commentators. Since the isosceles triangle ABC formed out of the square EBCD is 1 sq. pu. we have (Fig. (13(a)):
BC= AF = √15 pu AB 300 √3 ang =
= 464 ang 22 ti (approx.)
= 120 √15 ang 519 ang 21 ti. (

The one-twelfth brick, abc, for the first layer has each of its two equal sides one- twelfth of AB or AC and the base one-twelfth of BC The half bricks are obtained by dividing abc vertically by af, and the quarter bricks by joining the mid- points g, h, f of the three sides (Fig. 13(b)). Sundararaja prescribes the use of one- ninth bricks by trisecting the three sides of the one-twelfth brick and joining them, as shown in Fig. 13 (c). For the second layer, one-thirteenth and their sub- divisions are used. The dimensions are:

B&rsquo;, half of one-thirteenth-39 ang 33 ti; 35 ang. 25 ti; 17 ang 29 ti. All these values agree with Karavinda&rsquo;s. Dimensions of quarter and one-ninth bricks are not given.
COMMENTARY
249
If for the first layer, the two sides and the base are divided into 12 equal parts and the dividing points joined parallel to the sides and the base, the whole area will be divided into 144 isosceles triangles, each to be fitted exactly by the one-twelfth brick. The number 144 can be computed by permutation because, starting with one triangle at the apex it increases to 23 at the 12th layer with a common difference 2. For the second layer, where the sides are to be divided into 13 equal parts, there are likewise 169 triangles, each to be exactly fitted by one-thirteenth brick. Thus Sundararaja says: prathame prastare catuścatvārimśacchatena dvādasibhirudicyo dvadasa ritayaḥ |&hellip;aparasmin prastāre trayodaśibhiḥ navaṣaṣṭiśatena trayodaśa ritayaḥ | To complete the number of 200 bricks, in the first layer, 16 one-twelfth bricks in the middle four rows are replaced by 64 quarter bricks, and the apical brick is replaced by 9 one- ninth bricks, thus making up the deficit of 56 bricks. In the second layer, in place of 7 one-thirteenth bricks, 20 quarter and 18 one-ninth bricks are added to make good the deficit of 31 bricks.
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A RHOMBUS (UBHAYATA PRAUGA).
12.7-12.8. For the construction of a rhombus or two isosceles triangles on either side of the common base, Baudhyāyana&rsquo;s rules, Bśl. 2.8 may be referred to. The seven- fold fire-altar in the form of a rhombus, with the types of bricks to be used, has been discussed by Baudhāyana (Bśl. 15.1-15.6). In the case of the rhombus fire-altar, the bricks are to be made as in the case of the praugaciti, and these should be in the form of a rhombus, as Karavinda explains (karaṇāni cayanavidhiśca praugavat | viseṣaḥtūbhayataḥ praugāḥ iṣṭakāḥ|)
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM of a Chariot WHEEL (RATHACAKRACIT).
12.9-12.10. These two sūtras and the first three (13.1-13.3) of the next chapter deal with the construction of the fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel. Apastamba refers to the same type of rathacakraciti, as discussed in detail by Baudhāyana (Bśl. 16.1-16.5) and explained in the notes concerning these sūtras.
CHAPTER 13
CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A CHARIOT
WHEEL (RATHACAKRA) AND A TROUGH (DRONA)
13.1-13.3. As mentioned in the previous chapter, these three rules are in continua- tion of sūtras 12.9 and 12.10, dealing with the construction of a rathacakracit. This type has been fully discussed in connection with Baudhāyana&rsquo;s rules describing such a fire-altar (Bśl. 16-16.5).
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A TROUGH (DROŅA).
13.4-13.16. Of the two types of fire-altars in the form of a trough (droṇa), the square type in which both the body and the handle are squares is here described. The
250
APASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA
circular type is not discussed. Baudhayana, as we have noticed, discussed both the types, square-type in rules Bśl. 17.1-17.12, and the circular type in Bśl. 18.1-18.11.
In Apastamba&rsquo;s droṇaciti, the relative areas of the handle and the body of the trough are different from those prescribed by Baudhayana. The area of the seven- fold fire-altar being 108000 sq. ang., the handle measures 10800 sq. ang. and the body 97200 sq. ang. The area of the square body is 9 times that of the square handle and therefore the side of the handle is one-third of the side of the body. The sides
are :

The bricks are formed by the twelfth part of the side of the body, and out of such dvadasi square bricks, adhyardha (one side longer by half), quarter bricks etc. are formed, of which specifications are as follows:

The arrangement of bricks in the first and the second layers, for which the directions in the sūtras are quite clear, are shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b). In the first layer, 24 B2 bricks are placed,—12 on the eastern side, 4 each on the two western

<h1 id="the-total-area-added">second layer, the rule prescribes the use of 32 Bas,-24 in the body and 8 in the handle; the remaining space can be filled with 112 B1s, making the total number 144. The deficit in either layer is made up by replacing the required number of Bis and Bas by quarter bricks.
CHAPTERS 15, 16 AND 17
CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-FIRST TYPE
We have already met with Baudhāyana&rsquo;s construction of two types of fire-altars in the form of a falcon with curved wings and extended tail (1st. type, Bśl. 10.1- 10.20, 2nd. type, Bśl. 11.1-11.13). Āpastamba gives the construction of two other types, of which the first one is described in these three chapters, and the second one in chapters 18 to 20 to follow. We have thought it convenient to deal with these three chapters together because of the continuity and overlapping of the subject
matter.
15.2. In the falcon-shaped fire-altar, a head is to be provided, the tail should be spread out and each wing must be curved. According to rule 15.2, the curving of the wing is to be done by pushing the west side upwards and the east-side down- wards. Karavinda explains that what actually should be done is to raise upwards towards east the first half of the wing from its root at the body to the middle and to press downward towards west the second half from the middle to the end. (prathama pakṣārdham mūlādārabhya paścātprabhṛti prāgunnayet |.. dvayam pakṣārdham madhyā- dārabhya purastāt prabhṛti pratyagunnayet /). The method is further explained in rule
15.6.
15.2-15.5. Areas of different parts of the falcon. A simple rectilinear syenacit, as we have already noticed (Bśl. chs. 8 and 9; Ãśl. chs. 10 and 11), consists of a square body of 240 × 240 sq. ang. (4 sq. pu.), two rectangular wings each of 144 × 120 sq. ang. (11⁄2 sq. pu.) and a rectangular tail of 132 × 120 sq. ang. (1 sq. pu.). Some areas are taken out from the tail and the body (ātman) of the rectilinear fyenacit to build up the head and extend the area of each wing in the following manner :
1
Area taken out of the tail-120 × 12 sq. ang. or sq. pu.
1
Area taken out of the head-(120 × 120 + 8 × 900) sq. ang. or 11⁄2 sq. pu. Caturbhāgiyā is the area of a square of side 30 ang., that is 900 sq. ang.
The area of the head, which is built out of 3 caturbhāgīyās, is 2700 sq. ang. or 1 sq. pu.
The area of the tail, after the prādeśa portion is taken out, is 14400 sq. ang. or 1 sq. pu.
The area of the body, after 11⁄2 sq. pu. are taken out, is 23 sq. pu. or 36,000 sq. ang. Since the area taken out of the tail and the body less that used for making the head is added to the wings, the area of each wing is determined as follows :

15.8. The tail. The rectangle ABCD, of which AB equals 120 ang. and AD 60 ang. is flanked on its southern and northern sides by two rectangles DEFC and AGHB which are cut off by the diagonals DF and AH respectively, leading to the figure ADFHA which is the shape of the tail (Fig. 15(c)). AD equals 60 ang. and HF 180 ang.
15.9. The head. A square ABCD of which each side equals 60 ang. is constructed (Fig. 15(d)). From the mid-point E of AD, EF and EG are drawn to the mid-points F and G of DC and AB respectively. EFCBGE is the shape of the head.
Note that either side of the wing AB, CD will join exactly with either the south side GH or the north side KL. Similarly, the base of the head BC will fit in exactly with the eastern side EF of the body and the eastern side AD of the tail with the

16.2-16.10. Types of Bricks. Nine types of bricks have been used in covering the alternate layers of this fire-altar. These are :</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="heading">=</h1>
<h1 id="bg">B1 the first type,-a parallelogram abcd, of which ab = cd = 24 ang. and ad bc 20 ang. (Fig. 16). The sides are parallel to those of the paralle- logram ABEF or CDEF, so that this type can fit in the wings. Sundararāja gives the values of the longer diagonal ac as 35 ang. 20 ti and of bd as 26 ang. 6 ti. He also gives the breadth ed between the longer sides as 19 ang. 2 ti, which is of 2281 ang. (the length of the wing).
B2
B2 the second type, obtained by joining 2 B1s along the longer side such that the brick is bent at the middle (madhye nirṇatā ekapārsve unnatā- Karavinda) and suitable for use in the wing at the bending (17.5). the third type, obtained by joining the parallelogram abcd (B1) with the rectangle aefb along ab; ae = 15 ang. This is so designed that it can be used at the junction between the wing and the body, abcd lying within the wing and aefb in the body (17.5).
B3
B1 — the fourth type, obtained by first making the square abcd of side equal to 30 ang. extending it by half defc, and then cutting off the square by the diagonal bd; defbd is the brick, used in several places. de

<h2 id="wwwdand">the seventh type, gbfdg, is made by constructing three equal rectangles, so that ad de ag= 12 ang. and ab=ef=gh = 24 ang. and cutting the outer rectangles by the diagonals df and gb. The direction. of the diagonal is determined by dakṣiṇāvarayoḥ koṭyorālikhet.
the eighth type ahfda, is done in the same way as the seventh, with the difference that the northern rectangle is cut off by ah, as determined by uttaram tuttarasyāḥ koṭyā etc.
B, — the ninth type, an isosceles triangle of base 30 ang. and side 30 √Ž ang,
is obtained by dividing the square abcd (ab = 30 añg.) diagonally.
16.11-17.4. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks in the first layer is best explained in Fig. 17. In each wing 60 B1s are placed, with their longer sides, 24 ang. directed towards north. There are 10 rows east-west, each accommodating 6 B1s.
In the tail, 8 Bgs are placed on either side, in two groups each containing 4. Karavinda explains the disposition as follows-pucchāgre tisraḥ tāsām purastādekam | evamuttarasmin pārsve viparyasya kāritāḥ | At the junction between the tail and the body, 2 BAs are placed in such a way that the portion diagonally cut lies in the body. West of them are placed 2 Bs. The space now left in the tail consists of a rectangular strip, 30 ang. × 60 ang., followed west of it by two equal rectangular strips, each 30 ang. × 120 ang. ; 10 B ̧s (2 + 4 + 4) can be placed in these three strips (17.1).

In the central row 14 B1s can be arranged as shown, leaving two isosceles triangular spaces of side 30 ang. Kapardi calls the central row viŝayānām mārga, as bricks at the junctures (apyaya) partly lie on either side; he also confirms 14 B1 bricks in this row-viśayānām mārge tiryagātmani caturdaśa caturthyaḥ / The space available in the head together with the two isosceles triangular areas can be exactly filled with 4 B bricks as shown.

17.5-17.10. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The arrangement of bricks of different types is shown in Fig. 18. In each wing, after placing 5 Bas at the bending and 5 B2s at the juncture between the wing and the body such that the extended rectangular part (15 × 24 sq. ang) lies in the body, the remaining space can accommodate 45 B1s. 25 B1s lie on the southern side and 20 B1s on the northern side of the bending in the southern wing. In the northern wing the arrangement is opposite.
In the tail, 5 B, bricks are placed on either side, and the whole space is divided into 5 rows west-east. In the second and the fourth row from the bottom 1 B each is placed by the side of the B,s on either flank. This makes the total number of Bs 12. (evam dvādaśa saptamya upahitā bhavanti |-Karavinda). The remaining space in the tail is covered by 13 B ̧ bricks. Their disposition is described by Karavinda as follows: pucchāgre pārśvagatayossaptamyormadhye pañcāṣṭamyau | nanāgra dvitiyāyām! tisrāṇām saptaminām madhye tisro&rsquo;ṣṭamyaḥ | tṛtiyāyām ca tisraḥ | caturtharityām tisrāṇām saptaminām madhye ekā | pañcamarityām saptamyormadhye ekā | evam trayodaśāṣṭamyaḥ yathayogam prāgarāḥ pratyagagrāśca bhaveyuḥ ||

18.3. Areas of different parts of the falcon. One-sixteenth or soḍaśi square bricks are used here for purposes of measurements. The same method was used by Baudhāyana for measuring the circular dronacit (Bśl. 18.2). As already explained, the area is sq. pu. or 900 sq. ang., that is, a square of side pu. or 30 ang. Clearly, 120 soḍaśi bricks make 7 sq. pu. On this basis, measurements of the different parts of the fire-altar are as follows:

Note that the areas of the head and the body are the same as those of the first type of the falcon. Shapes of the different parts of the falcon are now described.
18.4. The body. It agrees with the body of the first type of falcon not only in area but also in shape (vide 15.7, 16.1). It is only differently described. One starts with the same rectangle of breadth 11⁄2 pu. or 180 ang. and length 2 pu. or 240 ang. The four corners are cut off, each by an isosceles right triangle of side 60 ang. (Fig. 15(b)). The area of each such triangle is 1800 sq. ang. equivalent of 2 soḍaśi bricks, so that a total of 8 bricks are taken out from 48 bricks that the rectangle holds, leaving an area equivalent of 40 bricks. Regarding the cutting of the corners, Kapardi advises the construction of 4 squares of side pu. and cutting them off diagonally—yathā śroṇyamseṣu catvāri caturaśrāṇi ardhapuruṣapramāṇāni kṛtvā akṣṇayānyārdhāni nirasyet.

18.5. The head. This is done in the same way as the head in the first type (Fig. 15(d)). Α square of side 60 ang. contains 4 șoḍaśis of which 1 is removed by the cutting off of the two eastern corners as described in the rule.
18.6-18.8. The wings. A sq. pu. equals a rectangular area, 120 ang. long by 71 ang, broad. If this area is added to the rectangle, 240 ang. × 120 ang. along the common side 120 ang., we get the rectangle ABCD so that AB CD 120 ang. and AD BC= 247 ang. (Fig. 19(a)). About the addition of 71⁄2 ang. to the side 240 ang., Kapardi says puruṣaṣoḍaśabhāgāścārdhonāṣṭārgulamātram dakṣine pakṣe cāyāmaḥ|
At the end, the rectangular strip EDFC of breadth 30 ang. is made and divided into 4 squares, 30 × 30 sq. ang. each. Each square is diagonally cut and the outer half removed. ABCD whose area is 2 sq. pu. is equivalent of 33 ṣoḍaśi bricks. An area equivalent of 2 sodasis is discarded by diagonally cutting the 4 squares, leaving an area equal to that of 31 ṣoḍaśi bricks.
In the middle of the rectangle less the portion where four squares were drawn up, the east-west line GHI is drawn perpendicular to the sides BF, AE. BF is 2171⁄2 ang. and BI 108§ ang. The point H on the east-west line is obtained by stretching a cord or a rod of 1 pu. such that BH equals 1 p.u. (Sundararāja explains-pakṣasya sardhasaptadaśadviśatāngulasya madhye lekhām kṛtvā pakṣāpyasyāparānte puruṣamātram venum niyamya tasyām lekhāyām nipatayet | så yatra nipalati lekhāyām tatra nitodam kuryāt | )
The point G is obtained by making GH equal to 1 pu. GA, GE, HB and HF are joined. Each of these sides equals 1 pu. Thus ABHFEGA together with the 4 diagonally intersected half squares EK,L1, L1KL, L,K,L, and LCF at the south end represents the shape of the southern wing. The northern wing is obtained in the same manner.

COMMENTARY
these 18 squares are 18 ṣoḍaśīs, that is, 18 sq pu. or 900 × 18 sq. ang. The required side is therefore 1√18 pu. or 30/18 ang. The point is explained by Karavinda as follows: aṣṭādaśa karotītyaṣṭādaśakaraṇi | ṣoḍaśīnām prakṛtatvātṭāsām aṣṭādaśānāṁ karaṇi | te khalu triṣoḍaśipramāṇanavatyangulasamacaturaśrasyākṣṇayābhūte / Thus, Karavinda puts it as the diagonal of a square of side 90 ang. (Fig. 19(b)), which again equals 30V18 ang. That the area of the tail is equivalent to that of 15 ṣoḍasis is clear from the figure.
19.2-19.8. Types of bricks. 6 types of bricks have been used in covering the alternate. layers of the fire-altar. These are-

The brick suitable for use at the end of the tail (pakṣāgriyā) broken in the form of four triangles. It consists of two parts, e.g. parallelogram abcd and the triangle ecd, and is a combination of B and B2 joined about the common side pu. The inclination is so adjusted that the parallelo- gram part fits in the parallelogram part and the triangular in the triangular part of the wing.
19.9-20.4. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks is clearly explained in Fig. 21. The rules start with the placement of B, bricks, -4 at the tip of the head ABC, 5 west of the line DE, 11 east of the line KF joining the eastern points of juncture of the wings with the body, 11 west of JG, the western line of juncture, 5 each on the eastern and the western side of IH, the junction line between the tail and the body, and finally 15 at the end of the tail LM. Thus 56 Bs are used (tã evaitāḥ ṣaṭpañcāśatpādeṣṭakāḥ—Kapardi).
4Bs are placed at each end OP of the two wings, such that the triangular parts cover the triangular ends and the parallelogram parts part of the adjoining para- llelogram of the wing. 4 B¿s are placed at either junction FG, JK of the wings with the body such that the triangular parts lie in the body. The total number of B ̧s used is 16. North of FG and south of JK each, 4 B1 bricks are placed in the body with their diagonally cut sides fitting exactly with the similar diagonal sides of the Bes. The remaining space in either wing is covered by 4 B5 at the bending MN and by 40 Bas, -20 B1s each on either side of the bending; Bs are turned eastwards. (catvārimsată catvāriṛśatā pakṣeṣṭakābhiḥ prāgāyatābhiḥ pakṣau pracchadayet-Karavinda).
The spaces of the fire-altar now left out are in the head between the rows of B, bricks, in the body between the B ̧s at the eastern and western ends and in the middle enclosed on east and west sides by Bs and on south and north sides by B1s, and in the tail between Bgs at the juncture and the end.

The number of bricks and their types in the different parts of the fire-altar are given in Table 7.

20.5-20.12. Placement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, 2 B1s are placed at the tip of the head with their diagonal sides facing outwards. West of them 2 B1s are placed, partly covering the head and the body, but with their diagonal sides. facing inwards. There are two ways of doing it, as shown in Fig. 22(a) and (b). The space between the two diagonals is filled by 2 B2s on each side of the 2 B1s at the juncture, 1 B1⁄2 being placed with its diagonal side facing outwards. Thereafter, B1 bricks are to be placed at the corners of the body. Bürk, in his Fig. 63a, placed 6 such bricks,-2 in the eastern and 4 in the western corners. All commentators have interpreted rule 20.7 as the placement of 4 B1s, one in each of the 4 corners (śronyamseṣu catasraḥ ṣoḍaśyo vahyaviseṣāḥ pratyantaviseṣaḥ Kapardi. tāsām sandhiṣu&hellip;
2
..sodasyaḥ catasrah-Karavinda.) The placing of 2 B,s,-one on either side of the western corners, to maintain the symmetry with the eastern corners, has also been suggested. The rules then direct the placement of 4 Bgs at the end of each wing, 6 B2s at both sides of the tail (3 on each) and B1s in the wings turned towards north 20.8, 20.9). From the geometry of the wing, it is clear that the parallelogram spaces in either wing can be divided exactly into 56 (7 × 8) small parallelograms for containing 56 B1s. Bürk&rsquo;s Fig. 63 shows 64 (8 × 8) which is incorrect. About 56 B1s, Kapardi says: ṣatpañcāśadviparyasya kāritāḥ; about 7 rows south north, in the wings, Karavinda&rsquo;s statement is : pakṣayorudicyaḥ pakṣeṣṭakāḥ sapta ritayaḥ |
■ Bürk, 385

ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASUTRA
Rule 20.10 directs that the remaining space in the body and the tail is to be covered by B1s. Now, after covering the body with 4 B1s and 4 B2s and part of 2 B1s at the juncture with the head (total area covered is equivalent of 7 ṣoḍaśi bricks), a space equivalent of 33 șoḍaśi bricks remains to be filled up; in the tail, the space yet to be covered is clearly that of 12 ṣoḍaśis. Hence, Karavinda&rsquo;s comment&ndash; avaśiṣṭamātmani trayastrimśat ṣoḍaśŝisthānam pucchadvādaśa ṣoḍaśisthānam. With 18 bricks placed in the head, body and tail, 120 in the two wings and 45 sodasi-spaces, the total number comes to 183. Then the geometry of the remaining space in the body is such that only 30 B1s can be accommodated and the remaining three soḍaśi spaces (30x30 sq. ang.) can be covered by 4 B2s and 4 B2s (20.11). In that way, Kapardi arrived at 188 bricks, still short of 12 (evam dvādaśonam śatadvayam () The arrangement of 188 bricks is shown in Fig. 22(a).
The deficit of 12 bricks can be met by replacing 12 B1s by Bs and Bs, as indicated in 20.11. The role of aṇukās, 30 × 30 sq. ang., in parallelogram form is not properly understood, for the same objective can be achieved by half bricks (B2).

second layer, following Kara- vinda, showing the placement
in the head, body and tail only.
However, a complete scheme explaining how 200 bricks can be laid in the second layer has been given by Karavinda. There is no change in the arrangement of bricks in the two wings, totalling 120. Accordingly, the placement of bricks in the head, the body and the tail only is shown in Fig. 22(b). The head and its juncture with the body are covered, as in Fig. 22(a), by 4 B1s and 2 B2s; at the juncture the dispositions of 2 B1s and 2 B2s are reversed: sirasi prānmukhe bāhyaviseṣe dve ṣoḍaśyau upadadhyāt | tayoḥ paścāt prāňmukhe bāhyaviśeṣe visaye dve ardhe | tayoḥ

pascattadviseṣaśliṣṭaviseṣe dve so dasyau viśaye ātmani / The bricks at the visaya are flanked on either side by 1 B2 as before, forming a line AB.

The body west of the line AB is divided into six rows in the east-west direction : tataḥ paścāt ātmani pracyaṣṣaḍritayaḥ | Beginning from the south, the first row contains 8 bricks,&ndash;1 B1 at each of the eastern and the western corners and 6 Bs in between. The second row has 2 B1s at the western corner end, then 1 B1, 6 B¿§, again 1 B1 and 2 B2s, of which the one at the eastern corner has already been mentioned. There are thus 12 bricks (dvādaśeṣṭakā eṣā |) In the third layer, starting from west of the juncture line AB upto the line of juncture CD in the tail, there are 8 B1s, of which 4 are turned eastwards and 4 westwards: tṛtiyasyam rityām siro’pyayaṣoḍaśyāḥ paścă- dārabhya āpucchāpyayamaṣṭau ṣoḍaśya upadheyāḥ | tāsām catasraḥ prācyaścatasraḥ praticyaḥ| The arrangements in the 4th, 5th and 6th rows are the same as those in the 3rd, 2nd and 1st respectively.

In the tail, 3 B2s are placed on either side as before. In the second row, south- north, the remaining space is covered by 2 B1s in the middle and 2 B2s on either side, and in the last row at the end by 6 B1s as in Fig. 22(a). The total number of bricks and their types, as per Karavinda&rsquo;s description, are given in Table 8.</p>
