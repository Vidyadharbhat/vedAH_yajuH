If it is desired to combine two squares of different measures, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller; the diagonal of the cut-off (rectangular) part is the side of the combined square. (Alternatively: If it is desired to combine two squares of different measures, a rectangle is formed with the side of the smaller (square)TRANSLATION-

(as breadth) and that of the larger (as length); the diagonal of the rectangle (thus formed) is the side of the combined square).
If it is desired to remove a square from another, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller one to be removed; the (longer) side of the cut-off (rectangular) part is placed across so as to touch the opposite side; by this contact (the side) is cut off. With the cut-off (part) the difference (of the two squares) is obtained.
A square intended to be transformed into a rectangle is cut off by its diagonal. One portion is divided into two (equal) parts which are placed on the two sides (of the other portion) so as to fit (them exactly).
Or else, if a square is to be transformed (into a rectangle), (a segment) of it is to be cut off by the side (of the rectangle); what is left out (of the square) is added to the other side. (Like Ã§l. 3.1, the rule is defective and does not lead to proper geometrical operation).
If it is desired to transform a rectangle into a square, its breadth is taken as the side of a square (and this square on the breadth is cut off from the rectangle). The remainder (of the rectangle) is divided into two equal parts and placed on two sides (one part on each). The empty space (in the corner) is filled up with a (square) piece. The removal of it (of the square piece from the square thus formed to get the required square) has been stated.
If it is desired to reduce one side of a square (that is, to make an isosceles trapezium) the reduced side is to be taken as the breadth (of a rectangular portion to be cut off from the square); the remaining part (of the square) is divided by the diagonal and (one half), after being inverted, is placed on the other side.
If it is desired to transform a square into (an isosceles) triangle, the square whose area is to be so transformed is doubled and a pole fixed at the middle of its east side; two cords with their ties fastened to it (the pole) are stretched to south-western and north-western corners (of the square); portions lying outside the cords are cut off.
If it is desired to transform a square into a double (isosceles) triangle (that is, rhombus), a rectangle twice as large as the square to be so transformed is made; a pole is fixed at the middle of its east side; two cords with their ties fastened to it (the pole) are stretched to the middle points of the southern and northern side (of the rectangle); portions lying outside the cords are cut off; thereby the (isosceles) triangle on the other side is explained.
If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, (a cord of length) half the diagonal (of the square) is stretched from the centre to the east (a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square); with one-third (of the part lying outside) added to the remainder (of the half diagonal), the (required) circle is drawn,

2.10 To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into eight parts;
one (such) part after being divided into twentynine parts is reduced by twentyeight of them and further by the sixth (of the part left) less the eighth (of the sixth part).
2.11 Alternatively, divide (the diameter) into fifteen parts and reduce it by two of
them; this gives the approximate side of the square (desired).
2.12 The measure is to be increased by its third and this (third) again by its own fourth less the thirtyfourth part (of that fourth); this is (the value of) the diagonal of a square (whose side is the measure).

Now, the placement of the ahavaniya from the garhapatya in the arrangement for the laying of sacrificial fires (will be discussed). According to tradition, the Brāhmaṇa has to place this fire ( āhavaniya ) ( at a distance of) 8 prakramas, the prince 11 prakramas and the merchant 12 prakramas (from the gārhapatya towards east).
Three squares of side one-third the distance (between the āhavaniya and the gārhapatya) are made so as to be in contact with each other (along the east- west line); the gārhapatya (fire) lies at the north-west and the dakṣiṇāgni (anvāhāryapacana) at the south-east corner of the western square; the north- east corner of the eastern square marks the place of the āhavanîya.
Alternatively, the distance between the garhapatya and the ahavaniya is divided into five or six (equal) parts, a sixth or a seventh part is added, the whole (of the cord measuring the original distance plus the added part) is divided into three (equal) parts, and a mark is given at the end of the second part from the eastern extremity. (With two ties) fastened to (poles at) the two ends of (the distance between) the gārhapatya and the āhavanīja, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a pole fixed at (the spot reached by) the mark. This is the place of the dakṣiņāgni.
Or else, the measure (between the āhavaniya and the gārhapatya) is increased by its fifth, the whole of it is divided into five parts, and a mark is given at the end of the second part from the western extremity. With two ties fastened to (poles at) the two ends of the east-west line (representing the distance between the two fires), the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a a pole fixed at (the spot reached by) the mark. This is the place of the dakṣināgni.
The utkara is explained by doing the opposite (that is, by reversing the cord and stretching it to the north).
To the west of the āhavaniya, as per tradition, is the altar for the new and full moon sacrifice (dārśapaurṇamāsa), measuring 96 angulas (yajamānamātrī) (in the east-west direction).

This (measure) less its third (64 angulas) forms the western side (of the altar) and half the measure (48 angulas) the eastern side; after making in this way a rectangle shorter on one side, poles are fixed at the (four) corners.
A tie is given at each end of a cord twice as long as the side (of the above altar) and a mark at the middle. With two ties fastened to (poles at the two ends of) the southern side, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a pole fixed at (the spot reached by) the mark. Fixing the two ties at this (pole), the southern side is circumscribed (with an arc of a circle from end to end) by the mark. Thereby the northern side is explained. The eastern side is circumscribed in the same way by a cord double its length, and likewise the western side.
The tradition has it that the altar for animal sacrifice (pasubandha) has 10 padas on its western side, 12 padas as its east-west line (prācī) and 8 padas on its eastern side; how it is to be measured out has been explained. According to some, the altar is measured with the measures of a chariot (that is, with akṣa (104 angulas) for the western side, iṣā (188 angulas) for the prăci, and yuga (86 angulas) for the eastern side). According to others, the sides are 10 padas each.
3.10 According to tradition, the uttara vedi is four-cornered and measured (on each side) by a śamyā (36 angulas); in the absence of any particular direction, it is a square.
3.11
According to tradition, the paitṛki vedi (used for performing pitr-rites) is formed with the third part. The third part of the mahāvedi is turned into a square; the side which produces one-third of this square makes that (of the paitṛki vedi). Therefore, it is one-ninth of the area (of the mahāvedi). According to others, its side measures 96 angulas (yajamānamātrī) and it is four-cornered, the corners being pointed to the four cardinal directions.
3.12 For performing the sautrāmaṇī sacrifice, the altar is advised to have an area one-third of the mahāvedi. If a third part of the mahāvedi is turned into a square its side will be 18 padas. It can also have, if one so desires, a shape in which one side is shorter and the other larger.

The sacrificial chamber (prāgvamsa) is 16 prakramas long by 12 prakramas broad, or else 12 prakramas long by 10 prakramas broad.
(A length of) 12 prakramas is left in the middle between the sacrificial fires.
According to tradition, the mahāvedi measures 30 padas or prakramas on its western side, 36 (padas or prakramas) along the east-west line and 24 (padas or prakramas) on its eastern side; how it is to be measured out has been explained. The mahāvedi is 6 prakramas from the āhavanīya (fire towards east).

The sadas (shed) lies 1 prakrama from there (east of the western edge of the mahāvedi) and is 10 prakramas wide (in the east-west direction) and 27 aratnis, according to another opinion, 18 aratnis long in the south-north direction.
The havirdhāna (shed for the soma-vehicles) lies 4 prakramas (to the east) from there; it is a square of 10 or 12 prakramas; how it (such a square) is to be measured out has been explained.
The uttara vedi is measured out at a distance of half a prakrama to the west of the pole of the yūpāvaṭa (sacrificial post fixed in pit). According to soma- sacrifice, the uttara vedi measures 10 padas; how it is to be measured has been explained.
The cātvāla (pit in the ground) measures 36 añgulas, or it may have any undefined measure.
The uparavas (holes over which the soma is ground) are each 1 prādeśa long, the distance between two of them being 1 prādeśa. A square of side equalling 1 aratni is made, poles are fixed at the (four) corners, and a circle of radius equal to half pradeśa is drawn (with each pole at the corner as centre).
Situated at a distance of 2 prakramas from the eastern half of the sadas (shed), the dhiṣṇya (fires) are each 2 prādeśas in diameter and separated from each other by the same distance (of 2 prādesas).
The side of the (covered) place for (kindling) the āgnīdhra (sacrificial fire) is 5 aratnis.
4.11 Thereby the mārjāliya (covered place for cleansing sacrificial vessels) is
explained; its door is made on the northern side.

The pits for sacrificial posts are (placed) at intervals of 1 akṣa (104 añgulas) and there are eleven of them as per tradition. The twentyfourth part of the sum of 10 akṣas, 11 padas and 8 añgulas is the prakrama. With this the altar is to be measured.
For the asvamedha (horse sacrifice), the twentyfourth part of the sum of 20 aksas, 21 padas and 8 angulas is the prakrama. With this the altar is to
be measured.
For the making of 11 pits along the eastern side, a strip of breadth half a pada is cut off from the eastern half of the mahāvedi and placed east of it in the east-west direction. In this (operation) 8 angulas are not taken into account, and there is no mutual connection.
4.15 The pits for the sacrificial posts are 1 pada (each) in diameter; the
circumference of the base of the pits is 3 padas.

puruşa). Thus by successively adding one-fold (1 square purușa), (one can go) upto 101-fold. Thus it begins with the 7-fold fire-altar (7 square purușa) and ends with the 101-fold.
Thereafter, to continue further, the 101-fold (fire-altar) is to be repeated (that is, after reaching 101-fold, no further increase is to be made). Otherwise, the sacrificial rite is to be performed without a fire-altar.
The aśvamedha (sacrifice) is an exception. If the aśvamedha (requiring a fire- altar of 21 square purușa) is performed without (the required agni) being reached, one fold is added to get the next higher fold (that is, 221⁄2 sq. puruşa agni); no other procedure is allowed.
If (the required fire-altar is) surpassed, the fire-altar following the one surpassed is to be constructed.
But how is one fold to be added ?
The excess (to be added) to the original form (of the fire-altar) should be divided into 15 parts and two parts be added to each fold (of 1 sq. puruṣa; after 14 parts are in this way added to 7 folds of 7 sq. purușa, the remaining part is added to sq. puruşa). The (new) fire-altar is to be laid with such (increased) 7 folds.
The height (of the fire-altar), according to some teaching, should be increased by the twenty-fourth part of the fifth of a jānu (32 añgulas).
Some construct the fire-altar from one fold (11⁄2 sq. puruşa) upwards (upto 61⁄2 sq. purușa) without wings and tail.
This is not justified because it contradicts earlier and later precepts.
In this connection some Brāhmaṇas maintain that among the fire-altars the making of the falcon-shaped one is the first sacrificial ceremony.
Other Brāhmaṇas maintain that after having constructed a larger fire-altar a smaller one should not be laid.
Our Brāhmaṇa teaches as follows: he is winged for the unwinged cannot fly; the two wings are longer (than 1 purușa in each case) by 1 aratni, and this makes the birds strong in their wings; the two wings and the tail measure 1 vyāma (each).
A falcon without wings and tail does not exist; so the fire-altar which is not seven-fold has neither wings nor tail; moreover, the construction of one-fold fire-altar after the seven-fold has been laid is inadmissible; for all this the seven-fold is the fire-altar to be made for the first time.
The clefts are to be avoided; the meetings of edges (between bricks) in the upper and lower layer constitute these clefts, as per teachings. Such clefts, however, do not exist either in the peripheries or the two sides of a corner of the fire-altar.

The fire-altar indeed possesses the characteristics of an animal. The southern bones of an animal are on its southern (right) side; likewise its northern bones lie on its northern (left) side and vice versa. That (part) which is below (on the western side) is the same as what is above (on the eastern side). In the same manner bricks of different forms are to be placed (in the fire-altar).
(Bricks marked with) lines turned to the right are placed on the southern side, those with lines turned to the left on the northern side, those with straight lines on the east and the west side, and those with three lines in the middle (of the fire-altar). The placing (of the bricks) in the middle (along the east-west line of the fire-altar) is to be understood in the same way as the backbone of the animal which does not lie more on one side than the other (but passes strictly along the middle of its body).
On this the Brāhmaṇa has it that Prajapati indeed is Atharvan and Agni is Dadhyan, son of Atharvan, and the bricks are his bones.
(In a fire-altar) where exterior limbs (such as head, wings, tail, feet etc.) are to be fitted (to the body, that is, the ātman of the altar), the middle of the side of the limb (concerned) is to be joined to the middle of that side of the body with which it (the limb) is to be in contact.
According to tradition, it (the fire-altar) is to be laid (with its head) towards the east.
The number of bricks is not to be completed with those which are not made of clay or which are not bricks.
As per teachings of this Brāhmaṇa, one fire-altar is laid with bricks, another with animals.
For the fire-altar has the characteristics of an animal: the yoni of an animal is of different forms; before laying the bricks, the sacrificial formulas from the Yajus text are recited.
Things occupying space are to be placed in holes (in the ground).
6.10 By (diagrams in the form of) circle, bull, woman, signs made on the bricks
are to be understood.

If the number of sacrificial formulas (recited) falls short of the number of bricks, the difference is to be made good by (the sacrificial formulas called) lokampṛņas because their number is unspecified.
6.12 Types of bricks previously used are to be placed here.
6.13 (There are) five lokampṛņas (in every fire-altar).
6.14 If the number of sacrificial formulas exceeds (the number of bricks), anointed
pebbles are to be placed in the interstices (between the bricks).
6.15 By the statements 'he places (the bricks) to the east', 'he places (the bricks) to the west' are meant the placement of types of bricks in a straight line (towards the specified direction).
6.16 By the statements 'he places (the bricks) to the east', 'he places (the bricks) to the west' are meant the directions faced by the constructor (of the fire- altar).
6.17 (Bricks) in the east are to be placed oppositely towards west and those in the
west oppositely towards east; such is the rule of restriction.

One should not use (for the laying of the fire-altar) a broken brick, a brick which is cleft, a blackened brick (due to over or under heating), a damaged brick and a brick with scratching marks. In the layer where a brick full of natural holes (svayamātṛṇṇa) is used it is not to be covered (by a brick).
The height of the brick is to be made a fifth of the jānu (that is, 6% angula); that of the nākasat and the pañcacoḍā half of that measure (that is, 3 añgula).
What is lost by drying and burning is to be made good by loose earth because of the flexibility of its quantity.
According to tradition, the gārhapatya fire has the measure of 1 vyāyāma. It (gārhapatya fire) is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
The (garhapatya fire in the form of) square is to be divided into 7 parts (length- wise) and then into 3 parts transversely. In the second layer, bricks are to be placed towards north (that is, the division in the first layer as aforesaid is to be reversed).
To place square bricks (instead of rectangular ones as indicated above), (square) bricks of sides one-sixth, one-fourth and one-third of 1 vyāyāma are made. Of them, 9 bricks of the first type and 12 of the second are placed in the first layer; 5 of the third type and 16 of the first are placed in the second layer.

Within the (gārhapatya fire in the form of) circle a square of the maximum size possible is drawn and divided into 9 parts (squares). The segments of the circle (between the circumference and the square) are divided into 3 parts each. The second layer is placed in such a way that the corners (of the within the circle) lie at the centres of the segments (of the first layer).

The dhiṣnya fires are one-layered in the form of a square or a circle.
Of these (dhisnya fires), the āgnīdhrīya is divided into 9 parts, and in one part a stone is to be placed (instead of a brick.)
The dhisnya fire of the hoty priest is divided into 9 parts and the 3 parts on the eastern side are divided into 2 parts each.
The others (dhiṣṇya fires) are each divided into 9 parts and then two parts, one in the centre and the other in the east, are combined.
Now the mārjālīya fire is divided into 3 parts and then the eastern and the western parts (taken together) are divided into 5 parts.
The bricks are to be made by mixing with ashes from the caldron.
This applies to those whose consecration lasts a year and not to those under- going it for a smaller number of nights.
7.16 Thus (the laying of) the fire-altar is completed with the sacrificial formulas
(recited by the priest).
7.17 After (a fire-altar made of) three thousand (bricks), a fire-altar to be piled with metres (of the sacred hymns) is to be laid. This is because of a difference in the wish. This (fire-altar) is falcon-shaped, as it is natural (for all such fire-altars).

Five (bricks) are placed in the southern corner and five in the northern. '(Let there be) the strength of the goat',—with these (words) he places (the bricks) in the southern corner; '(Let there be) the strength of the bull',-with these he places in the northern corner; '(Let there be) the strength of the tiger',-with these he places in the southern wing; '(Let there be) the strength of the lion',—with these he places in the northern wing; and ‘(Let there be) the strength of the man',--with these he places in the middle. (This is one Brāhmaṇa).
The other Brāhniaṇa is: The fire-altar is that which is constructed in the like- ness of the birds, that is, after the shadow cast by them while flying.

"To distinguish between the divine and the human (purposes), the fire-altar is to be constructed with square bricks',-thus feaches the Maitrāyaṇī Brāhmaṇa.
For (constructing) this (fire-altar), (square) bricks (of sides) the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the tenth part (of a purușa, that is 30, 24, 20 and 12 angulas respectively) are made.
Now the (area of the) fire-altar is measured out.
Two holes are made on a bamboo rod at a distance equal to the height of a man with uplifted arms; a third hole is made at the middle. What (measure- ment) is done elsewhere with the cord is done here with the bamboo rod.
The body (of the fire-altar) is a square of 4 purușa; its (southern) wing is a square of 1 puruşa made longer on the southern side by 1 aratni and its northern wing is explained in the same way; its tail is a square of 1 puruşa lengthened on the western side by 1 prādeśa. Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. puruṣa) is accomplished.
In the placement (of bricks) at a distance of one-third puruşa (40 añgulas) to the north from the end of the (southern) wing, 4 bricks of side equal to one- fifth (of a purușa) and 2 quarter bricks (one-fourth of the area of a pañcami brick, that is, 12 sq. angula) (are placed). Thereafter 8 bricks of side equal to one-fourth (of a purușa) (are placed). The remaining space of the (southern) wing is covered with bricks of side equal to one-sixth (of a purușa). Thereby the northern wing is explained.
8.12 Bricks of side equal to one-fourth (of a purușa) are to be placed on the eastern and the western side of the tail, and quarter bricks on its southern and northern side. The remaining space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa).

The same (is done) for the northern (wing).
In the south-western corner (of the body), 9 bricks of side equal to one-sixth (of a purușa) are arranged in the form of a square; the same (is done) for the north-western corner.
9 bricks of side equal to one-sixth (of a puruşa) alternating with 2 bricks of side equal to 2 padas are to be placed from the south-eastern corner (of the body) to the north-eastern.

Now another type (of square fyenacit).
(For this are required bricks of side equal to) one-fifth (pañcami) of a purușa; (those) with one side longer by half (adhyardha) of one-fifth (of a purușa); (these equal to) a half of its size (ardhyā of the pañcami); and (those equal to) a quarter of its size (pādyā of the pañcami).
In the placement (of bricks), half bricks (half of pañcami) turned towards north are placed on the eastern and the western side of the (southern) wing; the same (is done) for the northern (wing).
4 bricks longer by half and turned towards north (are placed) on each of the southern and northern side of the tail; 4 half bricks turned towards north (are placed) on the western side of the tail; and 2 quarter bricks on either side of them (that is, in two corners of the tail's west end). 1 half brick turned towards east (is to be placed) at each of the two places where the tail is joined with the hind part (of the body) (that is, at two corners of the eastern side of the tail).
The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with pañcami (bricks).
This is one layer of 200 bricks.
In the other layer, 4 quarter bricks (are placed) on each in the 4 corners of the body; 2 half bricks on two sides of them (in each corner); 5 half bricks on the eastern front (of the body).
At the end of each wing, 3 bricks longer by half (are placed) oriented towards north and 1 half brick (is placed) in each of the interstices between them (adhyardha bricks).
The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with pañcami (bricks).

Now (is described the construction of a fire-altar in the form of a falcon) with curved wings and extended tail.
10.2 Bricks for this (fire-altar) are made with side equal to one-fourth (caturthi) of a purusa; (then those equal to) a half of its size (ardhya of caturthi) and a quarter of its size (padya of caturthi).

Two of them touching each other along their long sides (11⁄2 pada) are made into (another) half brick (called hamsamukhi, swan beaked, with the same area as that of a caturthī-ardhyā).
The fire-altar is now measured out. The body is 2 purușas (240 añgulas) in length by 10 padas (150 añgulas) in breadth. From its south-eastern corner towards north a mark is given at a distance of 11⁄2 prakrama (45 añgulas); the same (is done) towards west. By stretching a cord over these (two marks), the (south-eastern) corner is to be cut off. Thereby is explained the cutting off of other (three) corners. This makes the body (ātman).
The head is of 5 padas (82) angulas) in length by purusa (60 angulas) in breadth. The two eastern corners of it are cut off with 1 prakrama (30 angulas).
The tail measures 6 padas (90 angulas) in the east-west and 2 purușas (240 angulas) in the south-north direction. The two eastern corners of it are cut off with 3 prakramas (90 añgulas) each.
10.7 The (southern) wing is of 12 padas (180 añgulas) in length (along north-south) and 10 padas (150 angulas) in breadth (along east-west). A pole is fixed at a distance of 6 padas (90 añgulas) to the east from the middle (of its western side) and at each of the two south-western corners (of the rectangular wing). With a cord (stretching between these three poles, a triangular area) is to be enclosed. The (triangular) area enclosed by the cord is to be cut off and placed on the eastern side (of the wing) (with its vertex) pointing towards east. This is the bending (of the wing). Thereby the bending of the northern wing is explained.
10.8
At the end of each wing, 5 squares of side equal to 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) are laid (in a row) so as to be in contact with each other; all of them are intersected diagonally in the downward direction (by joining the north- east corner to the south-east); and a half portion is removed (from each square).
10.9 Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold
(fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. purușa) is accomplished.
10.10 In the placement (of bricks), 1 caturthi is to be placed in the head at its junction (with the body) and 1 hamsamukhi (swan-beaked) to the east of it. 2 quarter bricks are placed on two sides (of the hamsamukhi), 3 four-sided quarter bricks below them on each side (of the head), and quarter bricks in the remaining space (of the head).
10.11 Alternatively, 1 hamsamukhī brick is to be placed at the (eastern) extremity of the head and 1 caturthi below it, to be flanked by 1 quarter brick on either side. 3 four-sided quarter bricks are placed to the west (of these two quarter

bricks) and on each side (of the head) and quarter bricks in the remaining space (of the head).
10.12 5 quarter bricks mutually joined with one another are to be placed to the west of the head (on the eastern end of the body) and the same to the east of the tail (on the western end of the body). Half bricks as well as quarter bricks are to be placed in the truncated parts.
10.13 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks and half bricks.
10.14 This is one layer of 200 bricks.
10.15 In the other layer, 4 hamsamukhi bricks are to be joined with 4 quarter bricks so as to form a rectangle; this is placed breadth-wise in the space of the svayamātṛṇņa.
10.16 At the junction of the tail (with the body), 2 hamsamukhi bricks, (with their vertices) turned towards west and their pāda sides lying within the body, are to be placed and below them and on both sides 3 quarter bricks (with their vertices) turned towards east.
10.17 At the western end of the tail 15 quarter bricks mutually joined with one
another are to be placed.
10.18 In the plumages of the wing 2 quarter bricks alternating with 1 half brick are
to be placed (from the west) to the east.
10.19 In the truncated areas at the joints (between the body and the wing, the
bendings of the wing etc.), half bricks and quarter bricks are to be placed.
10.20 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks and half bricks.

Now another type (of falcon-shaped fire-altar with curved wings and extended tail).
11.2 (In this case) the seven-fold (fire-altar) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is accomplished with 187 (square bricks) of side equal to one-fifth of a puruşa (pañcami).
11.3 The body can accommodate 52 of such (pañcamī bricks), the head 31, the
tail 15, southern wing 581 and the northern wing the same (number of bricks as the southern).
11.4 The corners (of the rectangular body) are cut off with vyāyāma (48 añgulas); the tail is inclined; the bending of the two wings is done with 3 aratnis (72 angulas) each; the six plumages (at each end of the wings) are to be made with the half of bricks longer on one side by half (that is, half of adhyardhā-

pañcami); the form of the head remains unchanged (that is, the same as that of the falcon-shaped fire-altar described before).
The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows. Bricks of side equal to one-fifth of a puruşa (pañcami, 24 ang, × 24 ang.); bricks of which one side is longer by half (adhyardhā) (36 ang. × 24 añg.); bricks of which one side is longer by a quarter (sapādā, 30 ang. × 24 añg.); bricks which are quarter in size of those with side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa) (pañcami-pādyā); bricks which are half in size (of the above, e.g., pañcamî- ardhyā); likewise, of bricks with side longer by half (that is, half and two types of quarter bricks made out of adhyardhās); triangular bricks made by joining two eighth parts, one from each of them (the eighth part of a pañcami to be joined with the eighth part of an adhyardhā, called ubhayi); and bricks of which one eighth the size of those with side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa). These are the ten (different types).
The pañcami bricks and their halves are to be placed in the body and the same in the tail.
The adhyardhā bricks and their halves (are to be placed) in the two wings.
11.9 In the head (are to be placed) such bricks as are possible (as can be
accommodated).
11.10 In the other layer, 1 ubhay brick (formed by combining the eighth part of
a pañcami with the eighth part of an adhyardhā) is to be placed at the eastern end of the (line of) junction of each wing (with the body); 1 ubhayi brick each at the western end (of the same line of junction); and 2 ubhayī bricks are to be placed on each side of the head.
11.11 At the western end of the tail, adhyardhā bricks (with the longer side) turned towards east, and at the two sides (western corners), bricks of size one-fourth and one-eighth (of a pañcami) (are to be placed).
11.12 Adhyardhā bricks and parts thereof (are to be placed) in the two wings.
11.13 The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be filled with bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

The bending of the two wings is done with 1 vyāyāma plus 1 prādeśa (that is, with 108 añgulas). 6 plumages (at each end of the two wings) are to be formed with 6 pañcamī half bricks. (An area equivalent to) 11⁄2 pañcami is left.
With this (area left out), two feet each measuring 1 aratni (24 angulas) long by 1 prādeśa (12 angulas) broad are made on the western end of the tail at a distance of 1 aratni from each other; at each side of the western end (of each foot) 2 bricks of size one-eighth (of the pañcami) (are placed).
Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. purușa) is accomplished.
The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows: bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa) and parts thereof (half, quarter and one-eighth of pañcami bricks); quarter bricks (having the area of a quarter pañcami) bounded by four sides (measuring )1⁄2 prādeśa (6 angulas), 11⁄2 prādeśa (18 angulas), 1 prādeśa (12 angulas) and √2 prādeśa (12 √2 añgulas); adhyardhā bricks (having the area of 11⁄2 pañcami) bounded by four sides (measuring) vyāyāma (48 angulas), 1 aratni (24 angulas), 1 aratni (24 añgulas) and √2 aratni (24 √2 añgulas). These make six (types).
Of them, four-sided quarter bricks together with the one-eighths are placed in two feet, and the remaining space is to be filled with bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

63 (pañcami) bricks are to be accommodated in the southern wing and the same in the northern.
The bending of the two wings is done with 1 purușa (120 añgulas).
From (a pole fixed at a distance of) 1 aratni (24 angulas) towards east from the western bend, a cord is stretched along the (line of) intersection of the westernmost plumage, and (the part lying west of the cord) cut off.
In this way (an area equivalent to) 51⁄2 pañcami (bricks) stands removed.
1 quarter brick is placed at each western bend (to fill up the triangular void caused by the aforesaid removal). Out of the brick types the four-sided quarter bricks and the one-eighths are to be taken away, and the remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be filled with (remaining types of) bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

A fire-altar in the form of an isosceles triangle (prauga) is to be constructed as follows.
An isosceles triangle equal in area to the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) pradeśa (that is, 7 sq. purușa) is laid. Bricks (called bṛhati) of length equal to one-twelfth of its western side and breadth equal to half (of the length) are to be made; then bricks which are half and quarter (of the bṛhatis).
Of them, two half bricks with their hypotenuses turned outwards are to be placed in the apex and half bricks on both sides.
The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with bṛhati and the number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.
In the other layer, 47 quarter bricks mutually joined with one another are to be placed on the western side (of the triangle).
1 sulapādyā (short-based quarter brick) in the apex (is to be placed).
14.7 4 quarter bricks,—2 wide-based (dirghapādyā) and 2 of the other type (e.g. short-based, sulapādyā), are to be placed in the space of the svayamātṛnṇa, and half bricks on the two sides.

A rhombus equal in area to the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādesa (that is, 7 sq. puruşa) is laid. As in the case of fire-altar in the form of isosceles triangle, bricks and their variations are to be made with the ninth part of the breadth (of the rectangle used for the construction of the rhombus).
15.3 The placement (of bricks in the first layer) is the same as before (as that of
the isosceles triangle).

According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel is to be constructed.
The chariot wheels are indeed of two types, e.g. those with spokes and those (formed) by the joining of circular segments (to a central square piece). In the absence of any distinction between the two, both are taken into consi- deration and described.
Now the (area of the) fire-altar is measured out. A circle of area equal to that of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is made, the largest possible square is inscribed in it, and bricks are made with the twelfth part of its side.
6 of these (bricks) are placed in each circular segment and the remaining space (of the segment) is divided into 8 parts.
The other layer is to be so oriented that the corners (of the square) lie in the centres of the segments (of the first layer).
Now the other type.
16.7 Square bricks of area equal to the fifteenth part of half a (square) puruşa are
made for purposes of measurement.
16.8
16.9
With 225 of them (of such bricks) is accomplished the seven-fold (fire- altar) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa.
To these (225 bricks) another 64 (bricks of the same kind) are added and with them (289 bricks) a square is made (as follows). (At first) a square is made with a side containing 16 bricks (in which 256 bricks are used up), leaving a balance of 33 bricks. These (33 bricks) are placed on all sides (actually on two adjoining sides, so as to obtain a square of side containing 17 bricks).
16.10 16 (bricks) at the centre constitute the nave; 64 (bricks thereafter) constitute the spokes and 64 the empty spaces (between spokes); the remaining (145 bricks) form the felly.
16.11 (The square shaped) nave at its borders is transformed into a circle (by the method previously described). The outer and the inner (squares) enclosing the felly are transformed into (two) circles. After dividing the space between the felly and the nave into 32 equal parts, the alternate ones are removed. In this way, the added area (equivalent of 64 bricks) stands withdrawn.
TRANSLATION
95
16.12 After dividing the felly into 64 equal parts and drawing (radial) lines (through these divisions), a circle is drawn through the middle (of the felly), making the number (of parts in the felly) equal to 128.
16.13 The spokes are each divided into 4 parts; the nave is divided into 8 parts. 16.14 This is the first layer (of 200 parts or bricks).
16.15 In the other layer, a circle is to be drawn within the nave at a distance equal to one-fourth (of the radius) from its inner edge. The same (is to be done) within the felly (at a distance equal to one-fourth of the felly's breadth) from the inner circumference.
16.16 After dividing the inner edge of the felly (that is, the circle drawn within it) into 64 equal parts, (radial) lines are to be drawn (so as to divide the felly into 64 parts).
16.17 (The space in each of) the spokes is divided into 5 parts from circle (in the
nave) to circle (in the felly).
16.18 The space in each interstice of the felly is divided into 2 parts, and there is
1 part in each interstice of the nave.
16.19 The remaining space of the nave is to be divided into 8 parts.
16.20 These are the 16 types (of bricks required) in (the construction of) the fire-
altar in the form of a chariot wheel with spokes,

17.1 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a trough is to be constructed.

Now the (area of the) fire-altar is measured out. The body is a square of side equal to 2 purusas.
Its handle lies at the western side (of the body) and is § purușa and 10 añgulas (that is, 70 angulas) long towards east and purușa (80 añgulas) broad towards north.
17.5 Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold
(fire-altar of 7 sq. purusas) is accomplished.
17.6
The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows: bricks of side equal to 1/6 purușa (ṣaṣṭhi); bricks of side longer on one side by half (adhyardha), half bricks (of the saṣṭhi) transversely cut; and bricks of side equal to puruşa (caturthi).

In the other layer, 1 adhyardha is to be placed in the south-eastern corner and the same on the north-eastern.
17.9 Şaşṭhi bricks are to be placed on the eastern front (between the 2 adhyardhās).
17.10 Bricks of side equal to 1 purușa (caturthi) are to be placed on the southern

120 (square) bricks, each of a (square) puruşa (ṣoḍaśī, side ang.) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. purușa) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa.
One of them is taken away, and (the area equivalent to) the remaining (119 bricks) is transformed into a circle.
This (kind of transformation into circle) has been explained in the case of the fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel of the first type.
The ṣoḍaśi (brick which is taken away) is placed in the middle of the east side (of the square equivalent to the area of 119 bricks) and with it the circle (of the same area as that of the square) is to be drawn.
The western part (of the ṣoḍaśī brick) cut off (by the circle) is placed on its eastern side.
18.7 The (four) circular segments (obtained by drawing the maximum possible square within the above circle and after placing 6 bricks of side equal to 1/12 of the side of the inscribed square on the base of the segment, as in the case of the chariot wheel) are each divided into 7 parts.
18.8

Bricks in the middle of the segments are each 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) wide.
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed by bricks half of the square bricks (made with 1/12 of the side of the inscribed square).

18.10 In the other layer, the brick in the middle of the (eastern) segment is placed in the lip (-shaped handle) and the space below it is divided into 2 equal parts.
18.11 This is the fire-altar in the form of a circular trough involving (the use of)
nine types (of bricks).
18.12 The construction of the samuhya and the paricayya (fire-altars) is explained in the same way as that of the fire-altar in the form of the chariot wheel as already discussed.
18.13 Pits are dug out in the (four) cardinal directions of (the space to be occupied by) the samuhya, and the earth is collected from them and placed on the samuhya (instead of the bricks).
18.14- The positioning of bricks in the paricāyya is different (from that of the chariot 18.15 wheel); these are placed all around in (concentric) circles turning towards
right.

19.1 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit) is to
be constructed.
19.2
19.3
The entire (area of the) fire-altar is divided into 15 square-parts. How to do this has been stated.
A rectangle is made with its length equal to thrice (the side of) the square- part and breadth equal to half (the side of the square-part). Lines are drawn from the middle of its eastern side to the two western corners and the two outer parts are removed (so as to obtain an isosceles triangle). This (isosceles triangle) is divided into 10 parts.
19.4 The entire fire-altar is composed of 20 of them (of such isosceles triangles).
19.5 In the other layer, one of the (five) isosceles triangles (into which the entire fire-altar can be divided) is to be vertically bisected. Each half is divided into 6 parts. These two (half isosceles triangles each divided into 6 parts) are to be placed on either side (the southern and the northern side of the fire-altar).
19.6
Bricks of length equal to one-third (the side of the square part) and breadth equal to one-fourth (the side of the square part) are to be made, and then half of such bricks by transverse bisection.
19.7 After placing them (the half bricks) on the two ends (the eastern and the western), the rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with the bṛhatī bricks turned towards east, and the number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.
19.8 The height of the fire-altar is to be increased by one-fifth (of the jānu, that
is, 63 angula).
98
19.9
BAUDHAYANA-SULBASUTRA
The whole of it (the height including the added 5th part) is divided into three parts and bricks are made with the fourth or the ninth or the four- teenth part of the two of these three parts (according as the fire-altar is intended to have 5, 10 or 15 layers).
19.10 With these bricks, 4 or 9 or 14 layers are made, the remaining layer (of thickness equal to one-third of the height) is diagonally cut in the downward direction and half of it removed.
19.11 Its division is exact. Larger and smaller bricks are taken according as these
fit.

The tortoises are indeed of two types, e.g. those with twisted limbs and those with rounded ones. In the absence of any distinction between the two, both are taken into consideration and described.
The fire-altar is measured out as follows. The body is a square of side equal to 10 prakramas (300 angulas); its corners are cut off with 2 prakramas (60 angulas) on each side.
4 squares each of side equal to 1 prakrama (30 angulas) are made in (the middle of) the eastern front and 2 of them lying at either extreme are cut off by their diagonals. The same is done on the southern, western and northern front. This is the body.
The head is 5 padas (75 añgulas) long by purușa (60 angulas) broad, of which the two eastern corners are to be cut off with 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) on each side.
The feet are to be raised where the corners (of the body) have been cut off. The foot (in the south-eastern corner) is 2√2 padas (30√/2 angulas) broad by twice that measure (that is, 60√2 añgulas) long and its eastern corner is cut off by 2√2 padas. Thereby is explained the cutting off of the other (three) feet. Of the two feet at the western (corners of the body), their western corners are to be cut off.
20.7 Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold
(fire-altar of 7 sq. puruşa) is accomplished.
20.8
20.9
(Square) bricks of side equal to one-fourth of a purușa, and their halves and quarters (obtained by dividing the first type diagonally) are to be made for this (fire-altar).
(Then one should make) adhyardhā quarter (that is, one-fourth of caturthis longer on one side by half) bricks bounded by four sides (measuring) 1 prakrama, 1 pada, 1 pada and √2 pada.TRANSLATION
99
20.10 Two of them touching each other along their long sides (1 prakrama) are to
be made into another (type of) brick (hamsamukhi)..
20.11 (Then one should make) another (type of) square brick of side equal to half
of 2√2 pada (that is, √2 pada or 15√2 añgulas).
20.12 In the placement (of bricks), a square brick (of side equal to 15√2 añgulas) is to be placed at the top of the head, followed by two hamsamukhi (bricks) below it.
20.13 5 square bricks and 2 quarter bricks (pañcamī-pādyā) are to be placed in
each foot.
20.14 Half bricks are to be placed wherever a corner has been cut off.
20.15 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number
(of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.
20.16 In the other layer, 1 hamsamukhi at the top of the head and 1 quarter brick
on either side of it are to be placed.
20.17 To the west of these on each side (of the head) 2 (four-sided) adhyardhā quarter
bricks oppositely oriented are to be placed.
20.18 To the west of these on both sides are to be placed 2 quarter (caturthi-pādyā)
bricks in alignment with the intersection.
20.19 2 caturthi (here called dvipadās or squares of side equal to 2 padas or 30 angulas)
and 3 half bricks are to be placed in each foot.
20.20 Half bricks and quarter bricks are to be placed wherever a corner has been
cut off.
20.21 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number
(of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.

Now the other type (of kūrmacit with rounded limbs).
120 (square) bricks of side equal to purușa (sodasi) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 73 sq. purușa) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādesa).
Of them 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks are taken away, and (the area equivalent to) the remaining (115 bricks) is transformed into a circle. This (kind of transforma- tion into a circle) has been explained in the case of the fire-altar in the form of a trough of the second type.
With 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks, (four) feet in (four) intermediate directions and the head in the east are to be raised. How to round off these bricks (for fitting with the circular body) has been explained.
The (four) circular segments (obtained by drawing the maximum possible square within the above circle and after placing 6 bricks of side equal to
1

BAUDHÃYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
of the side of the inscribed square on the base of the segment as in the case of the trough) are each divided into 7 parts. Bricks in the middle of the segments are each 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) wide.
21.6 The resulting bricks in excess (of 200) are adjusted by square bricks longer
by half on one side (adhyardhā).
21.7
In the other layer, the feet are divided in the same manner as the head (in the first layer) and the head is divided like the feet (as in the first layer).
21.8 Alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
21.9 A little loose earth is to be placed on the edge of the tortoise (-shaped fire- altar) and a large quantity in the middle of it. In the (fire-altar in the form of) trough, the oposite is the case.
21.10 According to some (teachers), the fire-altars beginning with the one-fold
should be (in the form of) isosceles triangles.
21.11 According to some other (teachers), (these should be in the form of) squares. Bricks are to be made with of the side of the square and half and quarter bricks thereof.
21.12 The increase (in the area) of the fire-altar for the aśvamedha (sacrifice) takes
place by the purușa and not by (two) aratnis and (one) prādeŝa.
21.13 This (aśvamedha fire-altar) is original and three times as large. Being three times as large, this fire-altar is twentyone-fold, and such is the tradition contained in both the Brāhmaṇas.
