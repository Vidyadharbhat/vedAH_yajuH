CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON
WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-FIRST TYPE.  

10.1. This type of fire-altar is constructed more in the likeness of a falcon. To achieve this the two wings are to be curved or bent and the tail is to be extended, that is, spread out. The body (ātman) itself should be cut out at its four corners, and there should be a head. The end of each wing is serrated to give it the appearance of being provided with feathers (patra). The laying of this type of firc-altar on the part of those who desire heaven has been greatly emphasized in the Brāhmaṇas. Here are a few excerpts from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa : “Prajāpati was desirous of going up to the world of heaven ;................ He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so. By contracting and expanding (the wings) he did fly up whence even to this day birds can only fly up when they contract their wings and spread their feathers"[^a]. Again, "He contracts (the right wing) inside on both sides by just four finger-breadths, and expands it outside on both sides by four finger- breadths;...... In the same way with regard to the tail, and in the same way in regard to the left wing."[^b]

Bricks for this (fire-altar) are made with side equal to one-fourth (caturthi) of a purusa; (then those equal to) a half of its size (ardhya of caturthi) and a quarter of its size (padya of caturthi). The cutting (of the caturthi brick to obtain its half and quarter) is always to be done diagonally in the absence of any advice to the contrary.

(Then one should make) quarter bricks (with the same area as that of a caturthi-pādyā) bounded by four sides (measuring) \\(\frac{1}{2}\\) pada, 1 pada, \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pada and \\(\sqrt{2}\\) pada. Two of them touching each other along their long sides ( \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pada) are made into (another) half brick (called haṁsamukhi, swan beaked, with the same area as that of a caturthī-ardhyā).

10.2-10.3. Types of bricks. For building a fire-altar of this shape which is fully described in what follows, rectilinear bricks alone would not do. Bricks of other geometrical shapes are needed, which are first dealt with. In the first type under consideration in this chapter, the following five types have been prescribed (Fig. 37).  

\\(B_{1}\\) -one-fourth (caturthi) square brick- 30 × 30 sq. aṅgulas; that is, a square whose side AB is \\(\frac{1}{4}\\) pu. or 30 añgulas.   

\\(B_{2}\\) -half brick (ardhā) obtained by cutting the one-fourth square brick diagonally; each of 2 sides AB, AC equals 30 aṅgulas and the diagonal side or hypoteneuse BC 30 \\(30\sqrt{2}\\) aṅgulas.


\\(B_{3}\\) — quarter brick (pādyā), obtained by cutting the one-fourth brick diagonally; each of 2 sides AB, AC equals \\(15\sqrt{2}\\) aṅg. and the hypoteneuse BC 30 aṅgulas.

\\(B_{4}\\) four-sided quarter brick (caturaśra-pādyā), of which CD equals \\(\frac{15}{2}\\) aṅgulas, BC 15 aṅgulas, AB 22 aṅgulas, AD \\(15\sqrt{2}\\) aṅgulas. 1 pada being 15 aṅgulas, the measures are given here in aṅgulas. padasaviseṣa means the diagonal of a square of side 1 pada or 15 aṅgulas or the hypoteneuse of a right-isosceles triangle of side 15 aṅgulas. Clearly, such a figure is obtained by joining the rectangle EBCD with the isosceles right triangle AED along the common side ED. Its area is  
\\(\frac{15\times 15}{2}+\frac{15\times 15}{2}\\) sq. aṅgulas 15 x 15 sq. aṅgulas, the same as that of the quarter brick \\(B_{3}\\).  

\\(B_{5}\\)-half brick ABCDE obtained by joining 2 \\(B_{1}s\\) along their common longest side AF; this is also called swan-beaked, haṁsamukhi.

The fire-altar is now measured out. The body is 2 purușas (240 añgulas) in length by 10 padas (150 añgulas) in breadth. From its south-eastern corner towards north a mark is given at a distance of \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) prakrama (45 añgulas); the same (is done) towards west. By stretching a cord over these (two marks), the (south-eastern) corner is to be cut off. Thereby is explained the cutting off of other (three) corners. This makes the body (ātman).

The (southern) wing is of 12 padas (180 añgulas) in length (along north-south) and 10 padas (150 aṅgulas) in breadth (along east-west). A pole is fixed at a distance of 6 padas (90 añgulas) to the east from the middle (of its western side) and at each of the two south-western corners (of the rectangular wing). With a cord (stretching between these three poles, a triangular area) is to be enclosed. The (triangular) area enclosed by the cord is to be cut off and placed on the eastern side (of the wing) (with its vertex) pointing towards east. This is the bending (of the wing). Thereby the bending of the northern wing is explained.

Areas and Shapes of different parts of the Fire-ALTAR.  

10.4-10.9. The body: A rectangle ABCD is drawn with AB equal to 2 pu. or 240 aṅg. and AD 10 padas or 150 aṅg. (Fig. 38 (a) ). FD, DG, HC, CI, BJ, BK, AL and AE are measured out such that each equals 45 aṅg. \\(= 1\frac{1}{2} prakrama)\\. Join FG, HI, JK and LE. EFGHIJKL is the body of the altar, with its four corners cut off as laid down in the rule. The area is (240 x 1802 × 45 × 45) sq. aṅgulas or \\(\frac{71}{32}) sq. pu.
The commentator measures the area in a unit of șoḍaśi which is 1/16 sq. pu. or 30 x 30 sq. aṅgulas, also called a caturthi, the area of \\(B_{1}\\). In this unit, the area of the body reduces to 351 caturthis,—evamāṭmaśroṇyamseṣvardhapañcamāścaturthyo nirastā bhavanti | atha ŝiṣṭā ardhaṣaṣṭhāstriṛśaccaturthyo bhavanti |—D.  

The head: A rectangle ABCD is formed with AB equal to \\(82\frac{1}{2}\\) aṅg. and BC = 60 aṅg. (Fig. 38 (b)). From the centre E of AD, EF and EG are joined, AE, ED, AG, DF each being equal to 30 aṅg. EGBCF is the head measuring \\(4\frac{1}{2}\\) caturthis or \\(\frac{9}{32}\\) sq. pu. (itarā ardhapañcamāḥ śiro bhavanti—D.).  

The tail: The tail is formed out of a rectangle ABCD, of which AB is 90 aṅg. and BC 240 aṅg., by cutting off the two triangles ABE and CDF, where AB = AE = CD FD = 90 aṅg. (Fig. 38 (c) ). The areas of the tail EBCF is 15 caturthis or \\(\frac{15}{16}\\) sq. pu.  

The wings: A rectangle ABCD, of which AB is 150 aṅg. and BC 180 aṅg., is formed (Fig. 38 (d)). At the mid-point P of BC a perpendicular PE is drawn towards east so that PE is 90 aṅg. Then the triangle EBC is cut off and placed on the eastern side AD as the triangle FAD. The area of the figure ABECDF remains the same as the rectangle ABCD. In this way the wing is bent or curved (nirṇāma). That the area is not affected by bending in this way is clearly recognized in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa: "He then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked.........he thus draws them out by just as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size) nor does he make it too small."[^a]  

For the construction of the plumages, five squares \\(DGK_{1} L_{1}, L_{1} K_{1} K_{2} L_{2}\\) etc. are drawn with side 30 aṅg. and intersected by the diagonals \\(DK_{1}, L_{1}K_{2}\\), etc. The outer triangular halves DGK1, L1K1K2 etc. are cut off.  

This is the construction of the southern wing; the northern wing is constructed in the same manner. The area of each wing is \\(32\frac{1}{2}\\) caturthis and of two wings 65 caturthis or \\(\frac{65}{16}\\) sq. pu.

The total area of the fire-altar, including the body, the head, the tail and the two wings is \\(35\frac{1}{2}+4\frac{1}{2} + 15 + 65\\) or 120 caturthis (or ṣoḍaśis), that is, \\(\frac{120}{16}=7\frac{1}{2}s.\\) pu.

10.10-10.14. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks is shown in Fig. 39 (a) and (b). Two methods are given for the head; the second method is shown in (b). In each case the number of bricks employed is 14. At the eastern and the western end of the body near the junctions with the head and the tail 5 \\(B_{3}s\\) are placed. In the truncated parts, \\(B_{2}s\\) and \\(B_{3}s\\) are placed. Since the head has already been covered, this means placement in the 4 corners of the body, 2 sides of the wing (excluding the western end), eastern and western sides of the curved wings and the feathers at the end. The rest is filled with \\(B_{1}\\) bricks.

As pointed out by Thibaut, the bricks specifically mentioned in the sūtras 10.10-10.12 total 68; the remaining space, as per sūtra 10.13, can be filled with 91 \\(B_{1}\\) bricks thus giving a total number of 159 bricks which fall short of 200 bricks[^a1].  

[^a1]: Thibaut, 210.  

The deficit is to be made good by using \\(B_{2}s\\) and \\(B_{3}s\\) as necessary. Dvārakānātha explains that there are 12 rows south-north in the tail and the body excluding the head and the wing (sirovarjam pucchena sahātmanyudicyo dvādaśa rītayaḥ). Starting from the end of the tail, 4 \\(B_{1}s\\) in the 2nd row are replaced by 16 \\(B_{2}s\\), 2 \\(B_{2}s\\) in the 3rd row by 4 \\(B_{2}s\\) and the middle \\(B_{1}\\) in the 8th row by \\(2B_{2}s\\). In each wing, excluding the feathers, there are 6 rows west-east. In each of the 3rd and the 4th row from the south, 3 \\(B_{1}s\\) are replaced by 6 \\(B_{2}s\\) and 1 \\(B_{1}\\) is substituted by 4 \\(B_{3}s\\). In the 5th row, 1\\(B_{1}\\) at the bottom is replaced by 2 \\(B_{2}s\\). The total number and types of bricks used in the various parts of the fire-altar are shown in Table 5.

rectangle ABCD with AD equal to 60 aṅg. (2 prakramas) and AB 45 aṅg. (3 padas) is taken in the centre of the body (Fig. 40). The placement of 4 \\(B_{5}s\\) and 4 \\(B_{5}s\\) is shown as per explanation of the commentator: svayamātṛṇṇāvakāśamadhyam gṛhitvā padatra- yavyāsam prakramadvayadirgham dirghacaturasram dakṣinottaram buddhyā parikalpya caturaśrapūrvapārśve pratyagagre dve haṁsamukhyau paścimapārśve prāgagre dve hamsamu- khyau | tāsām madhye dakṣinottarāgre antardirghapārśve pādeṣṭake | caturaśradakṣiņottara- pārśvayormadhyabhūtāntarālayorbahirdīrghapārśve dakṣiņottarāgre dve pādeṣṭake | evamaş- teṣṭakam dirghacaturaśram bhavati |

At the junction EF between the tail and the body 2 \\(B_{5}s\\) and 3 \\(B_{3}s\\) are placed and at the end of the tail 15 \\(B_{3}s\\). The end of the wing containing the plumages, TJKLMNOPQRST, is divided into 5 sections in each of which 1 \\(B_{2}\\) and 2 \\(B_{3}s\\) can be placed. The bricks thus mentioned total 58,-centre of the body 8, junction of the tail with body 5, tail end 15, and plumages at two wings 30.  

In the truncated areas, bendings of the wings and junctions (other than already mentioned), B2s and B2s are to be placed; as per Fig. 40, these are : \\(B_{2}\\)—28; \\(B_{3}\\)—14, total 42. In area, these 100 bricks are equivalent to 36 caturthis. Since the total area is 120 caturthis, the remaining space can be filled by only 84 \\(B_{1}s\\), leaving a deficit of 16 bricks. This is met by replacing 16 B1s by 32 \\(B_{2}s\\). D. proposes to do this in the following manner. In the wings, the body including the head, there are 18 rows west- east starting from the south. In Fig. 40, 9 rows are marked from the south to the central east-west line, there being another such 9 rows in the other half. 6 \\(B_{1}s\\) in the 8th row between the two extreme \\(B_{2}s\\) and 2 \\(B_{1}s\\) west of \\(B_{3}\\) in the head in the 9th
