The bending of the two wings is done with 1 vyāyāma plus 1 prādeśa (that is, with 108 añgulas). 6 plumages (at each end of the two wings) are to be formed with 6 pañcamī half bricks. (An area equivalent to) \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcamī is left.

With this (area left out), two feet each measuring 1 aratni (24 angulas) long by 1 prādeśa (12 angulas) broad are made on the western end of the tail at a distance of 1 aratni from each other; at each side of the western end (of each foot) 2 bricks of size one-eighth (of the pañcamī) (are placed).

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A KITE (KAŃKACIT)   

12.1-12.6. The kite-shaped fire-altar (kaṅkacit) is constructed in the same manner as the syenacit. The areas and shapes of the body and the tail are the same as those of the second type of the falcon with curved wings and extended tail. The area of the body is, therefore, 52 pañcamis or sq. aratnis and of the tail 15 pañcamis. The measure of the head is given as 5 pañcamis and that of the two wings 2 × 57 or 114 pañcamis. These areas total 186 pañcamis or sq. aratnis, leaving a deficit of \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcamis, as the total area of the fire-altar is \\(187\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcamis (= \\(7\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu.) This balance area of \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcamis, which is nothing but 1 adhyardhāpañcami (24 × 36 sq. aṅg.) is utilized in making the feet of the bird. The bending of the wing and the plumages are also slightly different from those of the śyenacit, 2nd type. The constructions are shown in Fig. 45.  

The head is constructed out of a rectangle 48 × 72 sq. aṅg. of which the two eastern corners are cut off by 24 aṅg. (Fig. 45 (a)). 

![](../images/fig45.png)  

Fig. 45. Parts of the kaṅkacit : (a) head, (b) tail, (c) divisions of 1 adhyardhā-pañcami, and (d) the wing with plumages.  

The construction of the tail EBCF is already explained under 11.4. ABCD (Fig. 45 (c)) represents the adhyardhāpañcami (24 x 36 sq. aṅg.), of which the pañcami part ABHG is halved and used as the two legs GILK and JHNM (Fig. 45 (b)). The half pañcami part GHCD (Fig. 45 (c)) is divided into 4 equal triangular parts and used as feet as shown in Fig. 45 (b).  

The wing is made of the rectangle ABCD (Fig. 45 (d)), of which AB=144 aṅg. (6 aratnis) and AD = 216 aṅg. (9 aratnis). For the bending, the perpendicular EP at the middle of BC is 108 aṅg. The plumages are constructed out of 6 half pañcamis (24 × 24 sq. aṅg.) diagonally intersected. Note that the area of each wing is 54 + 3 = 57 pañcamis.

The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows: bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa) and parts thereof (half, quarter and one-eighth of pañcami bricks); quarter bricks (having the area of a quarter pañcami) bounded by four sides (measuring ) \\(\frac{1}{2}\\) prādeśa (6 angulas), \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) prādeśa (18 angulas), 1 prādeśa (12 angulas) and \\(\sqrt{2}\\) prādeśa ( \\(12\sqrt{2}\\) añgulas); adhyardhā bricks (having the area of \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcamī) bounded by four sides (measuring) \\(\frac{1}{2}\\) vyāyāma (48 aṅgulas), 1 aratni (24 angulas), 1 aratni (24 añgulas) and \\(\sqrt{2}\\) aratni ( \\(24\sqrt{2}\\) añgulas). These make six (types).

12.7. Types of bricks. Six types of bricks are prescribed for covering the fire-altar (Fig. 46). These are : 

![](../images/fig46.png)  

\\(B_{1}\\) —square brick of side 1/5 pu, pañcami.   

\\(B_{2}\\) —triangular brick, half of one-fifth, pañcami-ardhyā.  

\\(B_{3}\\) -triangular brick, quarter of one-fifth, pañcami-pādyā.  

\\(B_{4}\\) —triangular brick, one-eighth of one-fifth, aṣṭami.  

\\(B_{5}\\) —four-sided quarter brick of area pañcami, caturasra-pādyā. The sides are 6 aṅg., 12 aṅg., 18 aṅg. and 12 √2 aṅg. (Fig. 46 ). Its area is 144 sq. aṅg. or райсаті 
B-four-sided brick of area 1 pañcami, caturaśra-adhyardhā. The sides are 24 aṅg., 24 aṅg., 48 aṅg., and 24 √2 aṅg. The area is (24 × 24 + 12 × 24) sq. aṅg. or \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcami (Fig. 46).

Of them, four-sided quarter bricks together with the one-eighths are placed in two feet, and the remaining space is to be filled with bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

12.8. Placement of bricks in the two layers. The rule simply lays down that the two feet of the kankacit are to be covered by \\(B_{5}\\), and \\(B_{4}\\) bricks and the remaining space is to be filled up by such types as these fit. Further details have been avoided as enough indications as to the manner of covering up such bird-like fire-altars with curved wings and extended tail have been given in the foregoing types. Following these indications, Dvārakānātha has proposed an arrangement for filling up the two successive layers, on which basis the Fig. 47 and Fig. 48 are here presented, after Thibaut.
