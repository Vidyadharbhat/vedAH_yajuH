CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-SECOND TYPE  

11.2-11.3. Measurement of the different parts. We have noticed the use of a new unit of square measure, the caturthi, 30 × 30 sq. aṅgulas in the case of the Śyenacit of the first type. Now another unit, the pañcami, 24 × 24 sq. aṅgulas or 1 sq. aratni (a square of side one-fifth of a purusa) is introduced. Clearly, 7 sq. pu. is equivalent \\(\\frac{15\times 120\times 120}{2\times 24\times 24}\\) or \\(187\frac{1}{2}\\) pañcamis, as stated in the rule 11.2. These units are distributed in the various parts of the fire-altar as follows:  

| The Head      | \\(3\frac{1}{2}\\)   | pañcamīs or sq. |  aratni |  
| The body      | 52                   | "               | "       |  
| The two wings | 117                  | "               | "       |  
| The tail      | 15                   | "               | "       |  
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|  
| Total         | \\(187\frac{1}{2}\\) | "               | "       |  



These given areas must be satisfied in constructing the figures of the various parts as we shall see in the following sūtras.

The corners (of the rectangular body) are cut off with vyāyāma (48 añgulas); the tail is inclined; the bending of the two wings is done with 3 aratnis (72 aṅgulas) each; the six plumages (at each end of the wings) are to be made with the half of bricks longer on one side by half (that is, half of adhyardhā-pañcami); the form of the head remains unchanged (that is, the same as that of the falcon-shaped fire-altar described before).

11.4. Construction of different parts of the falcon. Unlike the falcon of the first type detailed measurements of the various rectangles involved have not been given. However, with the indications given in the rule and the areas in the previous rules, the various parts can be constructed without difficulty.  
The body is made out of a rectangle ABCD (Fig. 41(a) ), of which AD=144 aṅgulas or 6 aratnis, AB = 240 aṅgulas or 10 aratnis and the area 60 sq. aratnis. By the cutting of the corners at distances of 2 aratnis (48 aṅgulas), 8 sq. aratnis are removed so that EFGHIJKL measures exactly 52 sq. aratnis.  
The head is constructed out of a rectangle 48 × 54 sq. aṅg. (AE=AG=ED=Df=24 aṅgulas) such that EFCBG measures 3 sq. aratnis.  

The tail is done in the same way as before. Here AD equals 8 aratnis (192 aṅgulas), AB 3 aratnis (72 añgulas) and the area 24 sq. aratnis (Fig. 41 (c) ). AB, AE, FD, DC being equal to 3 aratnis, 9 sq. aratnis are removed, leaving the area of the tail EBCF as 15 sq. aratnis.   
For the wing, the rectangle to be taken should have its side AD as 9 aratnis 216 aṅgulas) and AB 6 aratnis (144 aṅg.); the area is 54 sq. aratnis. The bending (nirṇāma) is made as before, the distance EP being 3 aratnis (72 aṅgulas). For the plumages, 6 rectangles \\(DGK_{1}L_{1}, L{1}K{1}K_{2} L_{2}\\) etc. are fitted at the end of the tail, diagonally intersected and outer halves rejected. Now, each such rectangle is adhyardhā-pañcami, that is, 36 × 24 sq. aṅgulas or \\(1\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. aratni; the area of 6 of them is 9 sq. aratnis and that of the 6 plumages (patra) after rejection of half is \\(4\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. aratnis. The total area of each wing is, therefore, \\(58\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. aratnis and that of two wings 117 sq. aratnis.

B_{8} -triangular brick, quarter of adhyardha, with a short base, BC = 24 aṅg., also called sūlapādyā (pointed like a spear).  

B_{9} -triangular brick obtained by joining one one-eighth of a pañcami brick ABD with one one-eighth of an adhyardhā brick_ADC along the common side AD (= 12 aṅg); also called ubhayi.

11.7-11.9. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The arrangement of bricks is illustrated in Fig. 43. As the sūtras have not given details further than some general directions, D's commentary has been followed to explain the disposition of 200 bricks.  
The fire-altar from the western end of the tail, through the body, upto the eastern tip of the head, excluding the wings, is divided into 15 rows south-north. Beginning with the western end as the first layer, the number and types of bricks are as follows :-   

|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|---------|
| 1st row, in the tail  —                                      | B1—6; B4—2 ;  | total | — 8     |

11.10-11.13. Placement of bricks in the second layer. By placing B9 bricks (ubhayi) at the eastern and the western end of the junction line between the wing and the body such that 12 aṅg. of the base lies in the body and 18 aṅg. in the wing, the sūtrakāra avoids the overlapping of edges of bricks in the two layers (Fig. 44). This is also the purpose of placing B9s on each side of the head and B2s at the end of the tail flanked at the western corners by Bыs and B10s. For the complete arrangement of bricks, we again follow the commentator who this time divides the tail, the body and the head in 12 rows beginning with the 1st row at the western end of the tail and ending with the the 12th row at the head. In this division the wing with part of the junction lying in the body is separately treated as before.

In his commentary, D. states 9 bricks in the head, 62 in the body, 21 in the tail and 108 in the wings; that is, he includes in the body 20 bricks at the two junctions of the wings with the body and 2 Bs at the junction of the tail with the body. In the number of brick types, there is no discrepancy: asminprastāre ekādaśa pañcamyaḥ | dvādaśa tadardhyāḥ | ekādaśa taṭṭādyāḥ | dve aṣṭamyau | ekavimśatiḥ | ubhayyo'ṣṭau | sapta- ṣaṣṭiradhyardhāḥ | catustriṛśadardhyāḥ | aṣṭāvimśatidirghapādyāḥ | ṣaṭ śūlapādyāḥ |.
