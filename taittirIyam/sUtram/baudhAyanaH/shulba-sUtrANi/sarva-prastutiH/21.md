Of them 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks are taken away, and (the area equivalent to) the remaining (115 bricks) is transformed into a circle. This (kind of transformation into a circle) has been explained in the case of the fire-altar in the form of a trough of the second type.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A 
TORTOISE-SECOND TYPE WITH ROUNDED LIMBS. 
 
21.2-21-4. The construction. Here the method of construction is the same as that already described in the case of the circular trough (chapter 18). We have seen that 120 sodasi bricks equal \\(7\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu. 5 ṣoḍaśi bricks are taken out and the area of the remaining 115 ṣoḍaśis (103500 sq. aṅg.) is turned into a square of side 321 aṅg. 24 ti (the commentator's value is 321 aṅg. 25 ti). This square is transformed into a circle of the same area as per Bśl. 2.9. In this act of circling the square, each of the 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks is cut by the circle and the western portion transferred to the eastern side. In this way, each of the 5 şoḍasi bricks is rounded off, one of them forms the head and the remaining 4 are attached to the circle in the 4 intermediate directions (Fig. 75).  

The next step is to draw within the circle a square of the maximum possible area. The side of the inscribed square, as we have calculated, works out to 256 aṅg. 25 ti.

The (four) circular segments (obtained by drawing the maximum possible square within the above circle and after placing 6 bricks of side equal to \(\frac{1}{12}\\) of the side of the inscribed square on the base of the segment as in the case of the trough) are each divided into 7 parts. Bricks in the middle of the segments are each 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) wide.

A little loose earth is to be placed on the edge of the tortoise (-shaped fire- altar) and a large quantity in the middle of it. In the (fire-altar in the form of) trough, the oposite is the case.

21.5-21.9. The side of the inscribed square, 256 aṅg. 25 ti is divided into 12 equal parts, and squared bricks are formed with side equal to each such part, that is, 21 aṅg. 13 ti which agrees with the value of the commentator (trayodaŝatilasahitaika- vimsatyanguleneṣṭakaḥ). But the commentator's value of 255 aṅg. 19 ti for the side of the inscribed square is inaccurate inasmuch as it leads to 21 aṅg. and 10 ti as the side of the square brick and not 21 aṅg. 13 ti as mentioned.  

As in the droṇacit, there are four segments. 6 one-twelfth bricks are placed in the middle of the segment in contact with the inscribed square and the remaining space is divided into 7 parts as shown in the Fig. 75. The breadth of the brick in the centre of the segment (pradhi-madhyamā) in between the square bricks and the circumference must be 1 prakrama or 30 aṅg. as in the droṇacit. 

![](../images/fig75.png)   

In the first layer, there are 144 square bricks inside the inscribed square, 24 square bricks in the segments and 28 bricks of different types in the remaining space of the pradhi. This makes 196 bricks. Now the pradhi-madhyama is pushed into the head and the vacant space thus created is filled with 2 bricks. The four feet are filled with 8 bricks of two types obtained in the process of cutting the sodasi square bricks by the circle of the body as referred to before. The total now becomes 206, that is, 6 bricks in excess of the required number of 200. This is adjusted by replacing 18 square bricks by 12 1 square bricks. (astädata caturasra uddhṛtya dvadasadhyardhestaka upadadhyāt). 

In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned so that its four corners now point towards east, south, west and north. The placing of the bricks is the same as in the first layer with the difference that the placement of bricks in the feet is as in the case of the head of the first layer and that in the head as in the feet of the first layer. The adjustment is made as before.  

The remaining sütras 21.10-21.13 do not call for much comment.
