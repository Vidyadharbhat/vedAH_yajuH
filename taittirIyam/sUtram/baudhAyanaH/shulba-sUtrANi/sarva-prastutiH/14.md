An isosceles triangle equal in area to the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) pradeśa (that is, 7 sq. purușa) is laid. Bricks (called bṛhati) of length equal to one-twelfth of its western side and breadth equal to half (of the length) are to be made; then bricks which are half and quarter (of the bṛhatīs).

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE (PRAUGACITI)  

14.2. Measurement of the fire-altar and the types of bricks. The area of the fire-altar should be \\(7\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu. Under rule 2.7, Baudhayana has shown that an isosceles triangle of \\(7\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu. can be drawn from a square of double this area, that is, 15 sq. pu., by joining the mid-point E of the eastern side AD with two western corner points B and C (Fig. 52). The base BC and each side EB, EC are given by   

\\(BC=  \sqrt{15}\\) pu.  
\\(=120\sqrt{15}\\) ang.   
\\(= 464.76 or 464\frac{3}{4}\\) ang. approx.  

\\(EB = EC = 300 √3 ang. = 519.6 or 519\frac{1}{2} ang.\\)   

D. therefore explains that a square with 4642 ang. (= 465 ang) is to be first drawn and the required isosceles triangle constructed, as already stated, in the following terms: tasyā dvikaraṇī pādonapañcaṣaṣṭicatuḥśatāngulā (4643 ang) dvistāva- tyāścaturaśrakṛtāyāḥ pañcadaśapuruṣāyā bhūmeḥ karaņi | evam caturaśrīkṛtāyāḥ pūrvasyāḥ karaṇyā madhyācchroṇi pratyālikhet | tatra karṇarūpayoḥ pramāṇamardhonaviṁśatipañcaśatāṅgulayaḥ (5191 ang.) | tasya praugasyāparasyāḥ karaṇyāḥ pādonapañcaṣaşṭicatuḥśatāṅgulāyā...... |

Fig. 53. Types of bricks.  

The following four types of bricks are prescribed (Fig. 53): 

\\(B_{1}\\)  —a rectangular brick, bṛhati, \\(\frac{BC}{12}\times \frac{BC}{24} or 10\sqrt{15}\times 5\sqrt{15}\\)sq. aṅg.  

\\(B_{2}\\)  —a triangular brick half of the brhati, diagonally intersected.   

\\(B_{3}\\)  —a triangular quarter brick with long base, dirghapādyā.  

\\(B_{4}\\)  —a triangular quarter brick with short-base and pointed like a spear, śūlapādyā.

14.3-14.4. Placement of bricks in the first layer. All that these two rules say is that half bricks with their hypotenuses turned outside are to be placed on both sides and bṛhati bricks in the remaining space. It is easy to see that 200 bricks cannot be used to cover the altar in this way. The way it can be done is explained in the commentary.   

The praugaciti is divided into 24 rows west-east (Fig. 54), 12 on each side of the perpendicular line from the vertex to the middle of the base, and marked 1, 2, 3.............. 12. Bricks are placed as follows :—   

In the 1st row on each side  —\\(B_{2} — 2;\\)      total — 2  
In the 2nd row on each side  —\\(B_{2} — 6;\\)        "   — 6  
In the 3rd-10th row on each side 
(that is 16 rows)    —\\(B_{1} — 88; B_{2} — 16;\\)   "   — 104  
In the 11th row on each side   —\\(B_{2} — 42;\\)     "   — 42  
In the 12th row on each side  —\\(B_{2} — 46;\\)      "   — 46
        
        Total : —\\(B_{1} = 88; B_{2} — 112;\\)           200

14.5-14.8. Placement of bricks in the second layer, For the second layer, the rules direct the placement of 47 \\(B_{4}s\\) at the western end of the fire-altar, 1 \\(B_{4}\\) at the apex, 2 \\(B_{3}s\\) and 2 \\(B_{4}s\\) to fill up the svayamātṛṇṇa space in the middle, \\(B_{2}\\) bricks at the sides and \\(B_{1}s\\) in the remaining space. The total number of 200 bricks can be completed in the following manner as explained by the commentator (Fig. 55):   

(a) In the apex:                                                                                        \\(B_{4}\\) — 1  

(b) In the western end (base), vertices and bases alternately turned in opposite direction :            \\(B_{4}\\) — 47   

(c) In between, there are 11 rows south-north of which sides are filled with \\(B_{2}s\\):              \\(B_{2}\\) — 22  

(d) In the centre of the middle row —\\(B_{3} — 2; B_{4}—2\\)                                                 Total — 4  

(e) In the 4th and 5th row, 3 \\(B_{1}s\\) are replaced by 6 \\(B_{2}s\\) each:                      \\(B_{2}\\)  —  12    

(f) In the remaining space:                                                                          \\(B_{1}\\)  — 114  

                Total \\(B_{1} — 114; B_{2}—34 ; B_{3} — 2; B_{4}—50\\)                                            200
