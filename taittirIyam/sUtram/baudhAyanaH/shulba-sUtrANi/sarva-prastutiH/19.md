THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A PYRE 
(ŚMAŚĀNACIT).  

19.1-19.2. The fire-altar in the form of a pyre, as we shall presently see, is a trapezium. For its measurements and constructions as also for the bricks, a new unit has been introduced. Let p be this unit. According to rule 19.2, 

\\(p^2 =\frac{1}{15}\\) of the area of the fire-altar \\(= \frac{1}{15}\times \frac{15}{2} sq. pu.    

\\(= \frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu.  

\\(p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} pu. = \sqrt{7200} aṅg. 84 aṅg. 28 tila.\\)

Fig. 69. (a) Fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit)—first layer. (b) Method of making isosceles and double isosceles triangular bricks.  


The fire-altar is in the form of a trapezium ABCD, of which the western side BC is 2p units (= 170 aṅg. 12 tila), the eastern side AD is 3p ( 254 aṅg. + 16 tila) and the height, that is, the distance between AD and BC is 6p (509 aṅg. - 2 tila) (Fig. 69). For the word trapezium, the word ekato'nimaddirghacaturaśra is used. It means a rectangle of which one side is shorter (than the opposite parallel side). The area of the trapezium is given by  

\\(2p \times 6p + \frac{p}{2} \times 6p = 15p^2 = \frac{15}{2}sq. pu. = 7\frac{1}{2} sq. pu\\)  

which satisfies the area of the agnikṣetra.  

First layer. For purposes of making the bricks, a rectangle ABCD is formed such that its length AB is 3p and breadth BC is \\(\frac{1}{2}p\\). From the mid-point E of AD, join EB, EC. EBC is an isosceles triangle (prauga) of area \\(\frac{3}{4}p^2\\). 20 such praugas equal 15p^2 or \\(7\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu. and can be accommodated within the fire-altar. To attain the number 200, each such isosceles triangle is divided into 10 parts in the manner shown in Fig. 69(b). The sides EB, EC and BC are each divided into 4 equal parts by marking 3 equidistant points on each side. The points on the sides are joined with those on the base as shown, so as to obtain 4 isosceles triangles at the base and 6 double isosceles triangles above them. About the formation of such triangles, the commentator says: evam vibhakte pṛthvanikasthāḥ praugākārāścatasra iṣṭakāḥ | tatastisra ubhayataḥ praugākṛtayaḥ | tato dve | tata ekā cubukāntā |   

Regarding the placement of 20 isosceles triangles EBC of area \\(\frac{3}{4}p^2\\), a line EF is drawn in the middle of the body (Fig. 69a). In the eastern half, 11 such triangles can be placed, 6 with vertices turned west and 5 with vertices turned east. In the western half, 9 such triangles can be accommodated, 5 with vertices turned west and 4 with vertices turned east. This represents the arrangement of bricks in which 80 praugas and 120 ubhayata praugas are used.

A rectangle is made with its length equal to thrice (the side of) the square- part and breadth equal to half (the side of the square-part). Lines are drawn from the middle of its eastern side to the two western corners and the two outer parts are removed (so as to obtain an isosceles triangle). This (isosceles triangle) is divided into 10 parts.

In the other layer, one of the (five) isosceles triangles (into which the entire fire-altar can be divided) is to be vertically bisected. Each half is divided into 6 parts. These two (half isosceles triangles each divided into 6 parts) are to be placed on either side (the southern and the northern side of the fire-altar).

After placing them (the half bricks) on the two ends (the eastern and the western), the rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with the bṛhatī bricks turned towards east, and the number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.

19.5-19.7. Bricks and their placement in the second layer. The entire space of the fire-altar (agnikṣetra) can be divided into five large isosceles triangles of base p and height (from vertex to base) 6p. Three of them have their vertices turned towards west and the vertices of the two in between them are turned towards east. The two isosceles triangles, one on the southern side and the other on the northern, which have their vertices turned towards west, are bisected by perpendicular lines drawn from the vertex to the base (Fig. 71). The agnikṣetra is thus divided into three portions, (1) half isosceles triangle CDE on the southern side, (2) the half isosceles triangle BAF on the northern side, and (3) the rectangle BCEF in the middle. Note that, since ED and AF are each \\(\frac{1}{2}p\\), EF = BC = 2p.  

To make the different types of bricks, the half isosceles triangle on either side is divided into six parts (Fig. 70). AB, BC and AC are divided into three equal parts each by the points, a, b, c, d, e, and f. Join bc, ad, de and cgf. The space is thus divided into 3 half isosceles triangles Bbc, cdg and dce which constitute the first type of brick B1. Note that \\(Bb = 2p, bc = \frac{p}{6}.\\) Through the above division, we get the second type B2, the rectangular bricks abcg, Aagƒ and fgde, of which the sides are 2p and p . The third type B, called the bṛhati, is a rectangular brick ABCD (Fig. 70(b)), of which AB = 1\3p and AD =1/4p. The fourth type \\(B_{4}\\) is half bṛhati (Fig. 70(c)), a rectangular brick measuring p/4 by p/6.  

The arrangement of bricks in the second layer is shown in Fig. 71. 3B1s and 3 B2s are placed in each of the two half-isosceles parts of the fire-altar. 8 B1s are placed on the eastern and the western parts each of the rectangular part of the fire- altar, with the longer side turned north-south. (Note that \\(2p/\frac{1}{4}p = 8\\)). These two rows use up up and the remaining vertical distance is (\\(6p—\frac{p}{3} = \frac{17p}{3}.\\)) The remaining space in the rectangular part of the fire-altar can be divided into 17 horizontal and 8 vertical rows in which 136 B3 bricks can be fitted with their longer sides turned east. Thus, the number of bricks used in this way totals as follows :  

\\(B_{1} — 6; B_{2} — 6 ; B_{з} — 136; B_{4} - 16; total — 164.\\)  

There is still a deficit of 36 bricks. According to the commentator, the deficit can be met by replacing 36 B3 bricks (9 from each of the 4 corners) by 72 B4s.
