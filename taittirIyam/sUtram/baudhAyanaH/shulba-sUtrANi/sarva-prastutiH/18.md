THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A CIRCULAR TROUGH, AND OF SAMŪHYA AND PARICĀYYA FIRE-ALTARS   


CIRCULAR TROUGH   

18.1-18.6. The construction of the fire-altar. For purposes of measurements, the ṣoḍaśī square bricks of area \\(\frac{1}{16}\\) sq. pu. or 900 sq. aṅg. (that is, 30 × 30 sq. aṅg.) are employed. Clearly, 120 ṣoḍaśi bricks equal \\(\frac{120}{16}\\) or \\(7\frac{1}{2}\\) sq. pu., the area of the fire- altar to be constructed. This area equals 108000 sq. aṅg. After deducting the area of 1 ṣoḍaśī brick of 900 sq. aṅg., the balance of 107, 100 sq. aṅg. is converted into a square of which the side obtained by taking the square root works out to.327 aṅg. 9 tila. Dvārakānātha gives this value as follows: tasya mūlamānīya navatilasahita- saptaviṁśatyaṅgulasahita-śatatrayāṅgulapramāṇena samacaturaśram kṛtvā....|  

The next step is to convert the above-mentioned square into a circle by the method given in sūtra Bśl. 2.9. and already applied in the case of the fire-altar in the form of the chariot wheel. Let ABCD be the square of side equal to 327 aṅg. 9 tila. (Fig. 66 ). EFGH is the ṣoḍāśi brick placed at the middle of the eastern side AD of the square. With O as centre and OM as radius a circle equal in area of the square ABCD is drawn, cutting EFGH by the curved line (dhanurvakrā) IJ. The part of the sodasi brick IFGJ cut by the circle is transferred to the top of the remain- ing portion, as KEHL. Now, KIJL, whose area remains the same as that of a ṣoḍaśi brick, represents the handle of the circular trough (also called oṣṭha).   

![](../images/fig66.png)   

Fig.66. Construction of the circular droṇacit.  
The value of OM, the radius of the circle can be calculated from the formula   
OM = \\(\frac{a}{2}(2 + \sqrt{2})\\), where a = AB = 327 aṅg. 9 ti.   

Putting \\(\sqrt{2}\\) = 1.414, OM works out to 186 aṅg. 7 tila.  

Alternatively, if AO = r,   

2r^2 = a^2 = 107100 sq. aṅg.

r = 231 aṅg. 13 ti.   

MN = \\(\frac{1}{3}\left(r - \frac{a}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\left(231 aṅg. 13 ti — 163 aṅg. 21 ti\right)\\) 

\\(\frac{1}{3} \left(67 aṅg. 26 ti.\right)22 aṅg. 20 ti. \\)   



OM=  163 aṅg. 21 ti. + 22 aṅg. 20 ti = 186 aṅg. 7 ti.   

The commentator D. gives the value of OM as 184 aṅg. 22 ti and that of MN as 21 aṅg. 1 ti. (tatra mandalakarane dvavimŝatitilasahita-caturasitiśatāngulo viṣkambhār- dhaḥ tena mandalakarane visaya upahitaṣoḍaśimadhye tilasahitaikavimśatyangulapramāņe maṇḍalam pravartate| ) The values given by the commentator are obviously wrong.

18.7-18.9. Arrangement of bricks in the first layer. A square PQRS as large as possi- ble is inscribed within the circle of the fire-altar as constructed above. The side PQ is given by   


\\(PQ^2 = 2r^2 = \frac{2πr^2}{π} = \frac{2 x 107100}{π}\\)   

or PQ = 261 aṅg. 6 ti (for π = 3.14)   

The commentator's value is 261 aṅg. 4 ti, which closely agrees with our value.  

Square bricks are made with side equal to 
\\(\frac{1}{12}\\)   PQ, that is, 21 aṅg. 26 ti (= \\(\frac{1}{12}\\) of 261 aṅg. 6 ti), which is also the value given by the commentator (......tasya karaṇyā dvādaśena ṣaḍviṁśati tilasahitenaikaviṁśatyaṅgulena pramāṇeneṣṭakāḥ kuryāt). The inscribed square PQRS is filled with 144 such bricks. 6 such bricks are placed in each of the four segments in the middle of, and touching, the square; 24 such bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is divided into 7 parts as shown in Fig. 67 (a), making their number 28. The brick in the centre of the segment in between the row of 6 bricks and the circumference of the circle is 30 aṅg. broad and is called pradhi madhyamā. With 2 bricks in the handle, as cut by the circle already described, the number of bricks in the first layer totals 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 corner bricks within the square by 4 half bricks of the one-twelfth type diagonally cut.

18.10-18.11. Arrangement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned such that the corners point towards intermediate directions Fig. 67(b). The square is filled with 144 one-twelfth bricks as before and 24 similar bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is also divided into 7 parts as in the first layer, making their number 28. To avoid overlapping of edges, the pradhi madhyamā brick is placed in the handle, and the space below is equally divided. The total number aggregates to 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 one-twelfth bricks in the square by 4 half bricks.   

Types of bricks. The sūtras do not specifically describe the types of bricks. From the descriptions, it is, however, clear that nine types of bricks are used. \\(B_{1}\\), \\(B_{2}\\), \\(B_{3}\\), \\(B_{4}\\) and \\(B_{5}\\) types are used in each segment; \\(B_{6}\\) and \\(B_{7}\\) in the handle; \\(B_{8}\\) is used in the centre of the segment in one layer; and \\(B_{9}s\\) are used to complete the number 200. The following particulars of the bricks are based on the commentary (Fig. 68).   


\\(B_{1}\\) — square brick, ABCD, 1⁄2 of the side of the inscribed square : side = 21 aṅg. 26 ti.   

\\(B_{2}\\) —  corner brick, EFG, in the pradhi : EF = 33 aṅg. — 12 ti ; EG = 26 aṅg ; FG (curved) = 41 aṅg + 25 ti ;śara = 1 aṅg. + 6 ti.   

![](../images/fig68.png)   

\\(B_{3}\\) — four-sided brick GECH in the pradhi ; GE = 26 aṅg. ; EC = 33 aṅg. — 12 ti; CH 42 aṅg. + 8 ti; HG (curved) = 36 aṅg. + 16 ti; śara = 30 ti.   

\\(B_{4}\\) — four-sided brick, HDJI, in the pradhi ; HD = \\(20\frac{1}{2}\\) aṅg. ; JD = 50 aṅg. + 10 ti ; JI = 31 aṅg. + 25 ti. ; IH (curved) = 51 aṅg. + 18 ti. ; śara = 1 aṅg. +27 ti.   

\\(B_{5}\\) — four-sided brick, IJKL, in the centre of the pradhi, pradhimadhyamā ; 17 = 31 aṅg. 25 ti; JK 30 aṅg. (commentator wrongly puts it as 32 aṅg.) ; KL 31 aṅg. 25 ti; LI (curved) not given ; śara = 42 ti =1 aṅg.+8 ti.   

\\(B_{6}\\) — four-sided brick, INML, used in the western part of the handle, here called oṣṭha; IN = ML = 9 aṅg. — 1 ti; MN = 30 aṅg. ; LI (curved) not given; śara = 42 ti.  

\\(B_{7}\\) — four-sided brick, OMNP, used in the eastern part of the oṣṭha ; OM = PN = 21 aṅg. + 1 ti; MN = 30 aṅg. ; OP (curved) = not given; śara = 42 ti.  

\\(B_{8}\\) — rectangular brick, QRST, used in the empty space in the pradhi in the 2nd layer, after 1 \\(B_{5}\\) is pushed into the ostha, is clearly half of a sodasi brick : QR= ST 30 aṅg. ; RS = QT = 15 aṅg.  

\\(B_{8}\\) — triangular brick, UVW, half of \\(B_{1}\\) diagonally cut; UV = VW 21 aṅg. + 26 ti; UW = (21 aṅg. + 26 ti) \\(\sqrt{2}\\) The commentator incorrectly gives the value of UV = VW as 30 aṅg. 15 ti.

THE SAMŪHYA AND THE PARICĀYYA FIRE-ALTAR.   

18.12-18.15. These sutras deal with samūhya and paricāyya fire-altars. These altars are circular in shape and constructed in the same manner as the chariot wheel without spokes. The samūhya is not covered with bricks, but by loose earth dug out from pits, as stated in the sūtra.  

The paricāyya is, however, covered with bricks in concentric circles. According to Dvārakānātha, 6 equally spaced concentric circles (agnikṣetre samāntarālāni ṣaṇmaṇḍalāni) are drawn. The central circle, the nabhi, is divided into 8 equal parts. Beginning from the nābhi, the second and the third annular spaces are each divided into 16 equal parts; the fourth annular space is divided into 32 equal parts; and the fifth and the sixth annular spaces are each divided into 64 equal parts. In this way, 200 bricks are completed for the first layer. There are six different types of bricks, for the dimensions of radial divisions differ from one annular ring to the other (pratimaṇḍalam karaṇabhedaḥ | evam ṣaṭ karaṇāni). In the other layer, concentric circles are drawn in the middle of each annular ring and the inner circle (of the first layer) is removed. Here also we have 6 concentric circles but of different radii. The division of the nābhi and the succeeding annular rings is the same as before; but the radial lines are to be drawn such that these do not coincide with those of the first layer. All these are done to avoid the overlapping of edges. Here also 6 different types of bricks are used.
