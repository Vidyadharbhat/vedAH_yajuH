As the total area of the fire-altar must be 1871 pañcamis or sq. aratnis, 101⁄2 pañcamis are to be removed from the wings. The construction of the wing and the method of removing the excess area are explained in 13.3-13.5, 13.6 (part). 
The area of each wing being 63 pañcamis and 6 plumages, each of half-pañcami, needing an area of 3 pañcamis only by analogy with the kankacit wing, the rectangular area forming the main part of the wing to be bent should measure 60 pañcamis or 6 aratnis × 10 aratnis (144 ang. × 240 añg.). ABCD is such a rectangle of which AB 144 ang. and BC 240 ang. After bending, it assumes the form ABECDF so that EP = IF = 120 ang. IE clearly equals 24 ang. or I aratni. The patras are DK11, LKL2 etc. From the geometry it is clear that I, J, L5 H lie on the same straight line. Hence the direction (rule 13.4) that, by stretching a cord IH, the area IECH west of the southern half of the wing including the patras should be cut off. The

area of the wing south of the nirṇāma line EF is 33 pañcami and that of IECH ** or 53 pañcami. The first line of rule 13.6 prescribes that a triangular area EIJ measuring a quarter brick, that is ‡ pañcami is to be added. In other words, the actual area to be removed is ECHJ measuring (51 — 1) or 51 pañcami; for two wings the area to be removed is 10 pañcami. 
13.6. (remaining part). Placement of bricks in the two layers. For the placement of bricks, only B1, B2, B, and B, as described for the kankacit, are required and not B (aşṭami) and B (caturaśra-pādyā), because the fire-altar is without feet and B and B bricks are needed to cover them.

CHAPTER 14 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE (PRAUGACITI) 
14.2. Measurement of the fire-altar and the types of bricks. The area of the fire-altar should be 71 sq. pu. Under rule 2.7, Baudhayana has shown that an isosceles triangle of 71 sq. pu. can be drawn from a square of double this area, that is, 15 sq. pu., by joining the mid-point E of the eastern side AD with two western corner points B and C (Fig. 52). The base BC and each side EB, EC are given by 
BC= √15 pu. 
120 √15 ang. 
464.76 or 464 ang. approx. 
EB == 
EC 
300 √3 ang. 
= 
519.6 or 5191 ang. 
D. therefore explains that a square with 4642 ang. (= 465 ang) is to be first drawn and the required isosceles triangle constructed, as already stated, in the following terms: tasyā dvikaraṇī pādonapañcaṣaṣṭicatuḥśatāngulā (4643 ang) dvistāva- tyāścaturaśrakṛtāyāḥ pañcadaśapuruṣāyā bhūmeḥ karaņi | evam caturaśrīkṛtāyāḥ pūrvasyāḥ karaṇyā madhyācchroṇi pratyālikhet | tatra karṇarūpayoḥ pramāṇamardhonavimś ati- pañcaśatāngulayaḥ (5191 ang.) | tasya praugasyāparasyāḥ karaṇyāḥ pādonapañcaṣaşṭic atu- ḥśatāṁgulāyā...... |

The praugaciti is divided into 24 rows west-east (Fig. 54), 12 on each side of the perpendicular line from the vertex to the middle of the base, and marked 1, 2, 3.............. 12. Bricks are placed as follows :—

on 
15.2. The construction and the types of bricks. The method of construction of a rhombus or double isosceles triangle having common base and the two vertices the opposite sides is given in Bŝl. 2.8. ABCD and BEFC are two equal squares, each of area 71 sq. pu. GBHC is the desired rhombus of 71⁄2 sq. pu. of which G and H are the mid-points of AD and EF respectively.

Four types of bricks are made in the same way as those for the isosceles fire- 
altar (14.2). B1, the rectangular brick, bṛhati, is 
Bз (dirghapādyā) and B (śūlapādyā) are made by diagonal intersections of the brhati as before.

15.3. Placement of bricks in the first layer. BC is divided into 18 equal parts and marked and likewise GH in 18 equal parts and marked. Lines parallel to BC and GH are drawn. It is easily seen that the entire area is divided into 144 rectangles where an equal number of bṛhati bricks can be placed and into 36 half rectangles along the sides where an equal number of ardhyās can be placed. Thus we get 180 bricks. The deficit is met by replacing 10 B1s in the 6th vertical row on either side of the central line GH by 20 B2s. With the above substitution, the total number of B1s is 124 and that of B2s 76. On these points, the commentary runs as follows : ṣaṣṭhi dvādaśeṣ- takā tatra madhyāddaśa bṛhatirudhṛtya vimśatirardhyāḥ....asminprastāre caturvimśatisatam bṛhatyaḥ | satsaptatirardhyāḥ |

As per directions in the rules, 2 B1s (sūlapādyā) are to be placed one each at the apices G and H and 2 B ̧s (dirghapādyā), one each at B and C (Fig. 58). The remaining space can be divided into 17 horizontal (south-north) and 17 vertical (west-east) rows. In the middle (svayamātṛṇṇa) of the fire-altar, 2 Bòs and 2 B4s are placed as shown. It is easy to see that the remaining space can be filled by 32 B2s at the sides and 144 B1s with the longer side turned east or west. This accounts for 184 bricks. The number is completed by replacing 16 B1s, four each of the four directions, by 32 B2s. The total number of bricks of different types are: B1

CHAPTER 16 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A 
CHARIOT WHEEL (RATHACAKRACITI) 
215 
16.1-16.2. Fire-altars in the form of a chariot-wheel are of two types: (a) a square piece with four circular segments attached one on each side so as to give the whole structure a circular shape, and (b) a circular wheel provided with spokes. Both types. are used for sacrificial purposes and are described in this chapter. 
THE CHARIOT WHEEL WITH CIRCULAR SEGMENTS. 
16.3. The construction and brick types. The method of constructing a circle equivalent to that of a square area, in this case 7 sq. pu., has been given in rule 2.9 and has already been discussed. Fig. 59 represents the required circle of area 7 sq. pu., within which is drawn the largest possible square ABCD. The space bounded by each side of the square and the arc of the circle is called pradhi (segment); there are four such segments. 
Let the side of the square AB or AD be a and the radius of the circle AO be r.

Fig. 59 
In the above calculations, π has been taken to be 3.14. D. gives the value of r as 185 ang. 14 ti. (madhye śańkum nihatya pañcāśītiśatāñngulena caturdaśatilayuktena pariman- dala bhramayet). His value of a is 262 ang. 7 ti (tasya madhye viskambhārdhadvikaraṇyā (r √2) saptatiladhikayā dviṣaṣṭiśatadvayāngulayā samacaturaśram kuryāt). It appears that in giving these values Dvārakānātha used the more approximate correct value of л. The square bricks are then made with each side equal to the twelfth part of AD, which, according to D's value of the side of the inscribed square, is 21 ang. 29 ti (that is, 22 ang- 5 ti). 
16.4-16.5. Placement of bricks. 144 bricks of the type mentioned above can be placed within the square ABCD. In the segments, 6 such bricks are placed adjoining the middle side of the square and the remaining space is divided into 8 parts (Fig. 60 (a), (b)). Thus each segment contains 14 bricks and four segments account for 56 bricks, making the total number 200. Regarding the placement of bricks in each segment, D. explains as follows: pradhimulamadhye ṣaț caturaśră upadhāya tasya pradheḥ sesamaṣṭadhā vibhajet | upahitānām ṣaṇṇām pārsvayordve dve mukhe catasra iti [

ag, hg, ih and ji are curved. D. neglected the curvature of ag, but considered the rest by giving the values of the śara, the distance between the centre of the arc and the respective chord in each case. For hg, ih and ji, these values are 31 ti; 26 ti., and 25 ti. respectively. Calculation of arcs and their saras were obviously consi- dered important mathematical exercises in medieval India when these commentaries were prepared. 
In the second layer the inscribed square is turned such that its corner lies in the centre of each segment of the first layer in order to avoid the overlapping of the edges of the bricks between layers. 
THE CHARIOT WHEEL WITH SPOKES. 
16.6-16.11. The measurement and the construction of the wheel. For purposes of measure- ment of a wheel of this type, square bricks each of area sq. pu. are used. 
15 x 30 The total area of the fire-altar, 1 sq. pu. will therefore involve 
or 225 bricks. The side of each brick a is given by :

Fig. 61. Construction of the chariot wheel (rathacakra) fire-altar. 
Now, 225 is a squared number 152. A chariot wheel with spokes consists of the central circular part, the nave, the spokes and the outer circular rim, the felly. The spokes connecting the nave and the felly alternate with empty spaces. In the procedure suggested, an area equivalent to the empty spaces between spokes is first added and then removed. This area is here taken to be equivalent to that of 64 square bricks of the type described above, probably because 225 plus 64 make 289, a squared number 172. Hence the direction of arranging 289 bricks in the form of a square so that each side contains 17 bricks. This is done in two stages; at first 256 bricks are arranged in a square, each side containing 16 bricks, and then 33 bricks, -17 plus 16, are placed along two adjoining sides. In this way the square ABCD is formed (Fig. 61 ). 
In the central region of the above square, another square EFGH of 16 bricks is formed. As D. explains, it is constructed out of the central square of 25 bricks by putting 4 poles, one each at the centre of the corner bricks, at E, F, G and H, and then joining them. The square EFGH forms the nave (nābhi). 
In the same manner, another square IJKL is formed of 144 bricks, centrally placed within ABCD. This is again done out of a square of 169 bricks, each side containing 13 bricks. A pole is placed at the centre of each of the four corner bricks, I, J, K and L, and these poles are joined. The area between the squares IJKL and EFGH is equivalent to the area of 128 (144-16) bricks, half of which, that is, 64, is used for making the spokes (arā) and the remaining half (64 bricks) for the empty spaces (vedi). 
218 
BAUDHĀYANA-ŠULBASUTRA 
The space between the squares ABCD and IJKL, equivalent to 145 (289-144) bricks constitutes the felly (nemi). 
Then three squares ABCD, EFGH and IJKL are turned into circles of radii OM, OP and ON respectively, according to the method given in rule 2.9. The space between the felly and the nave, that is between the circles of radii ON and OP is radially divided into 32 equal parts and half of them, in alternate order, is removed. In this way, an area equivalent to that of 64 bricks is rejected, and the remaining area of the wheel with the nave, spokes and the felly is exactly equal to that of 225 bricks or 7 sq. pu. 
16.12-16.14. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The felly (nemi) is divided into 64 equal parts. We have seen that the annular space comprising the spokes and the empty spaces was divided into 32 equal parts by radial lines. These are projected into the felly, dividing it at first into 32 equal parts, and each part is then equally divided by radial lines confined between the outer and the inner circumference. Now a concentric circle passing through the middle of these two circumferences of the felly is drawn, dividing its space into 128 parts. Note that the area of each part lying outside the middle circumference is different from that lying within. Accordingly, two types of bricks are required to cover the felly, as D. points out -- hāhyāścatuḥṣaṣṭi | tāsāmekam karaṇam | antataścatuḥṣaṣṭi | tāsāmekam karaṇam | 
Fig. 62. Arrangement of bricks in the 1st layer (after Thibaut). 
Each spoke is divided into 4 parts, thereby involving the use of 64 bricks of four different types. Finally the nave is divided into 8 equal parts to make the total number of bricks in the first layer 200. Thus seven different types of bricks are required to cover the first layer-evam sapta karaṇāni | eṣa prathamaḥ prastāraḥ | evam fatadvayasampattiḥ -D. 
219 
COMMENTARY 
Fig. 63. Arrangement of bricks in the 2nd layer (after Thibaut). 
16.15-16-20. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The general principle of avoiding overlapping of cleavages of bricks in the two layers is to be kept in view. For this reason, a circle shorter by one-fourth ( OP) is drawn within the nave; its distance from the edge is therefore a quarter. In the felly, a concentric circle is drawn so that its distance from the inner edge is one-fourth the breadth of the felly (nemimabhyan- tarato nemipramāṇacaturthabhāge'tite parikṛṣet—D.) 
The annular space of the felly between this new circle and the outermost one is divided into 64 equal parts and filled with bricks of one type. Each of the 16 spokes extending from the newly drawn inner circle in the nave upto the newly drawn inner circle of the felly is divided into 5 parts and 5 different types of bricks are used. The spokes will thus involve the use of 80 bricks. In between spokes, in the region of the felly, there are 16 spaces, each of which is divided into two equal parts, and 32 bricks of another type are used to fill them up (arāṇāmantarāleṣu vedipradeśasamipe nemyām dve dve iṣṭake | ....tāsāmṣkam karaṇam | tā dvātriṛśat—D.). Likewise, there are 16 spaces in the nave between the spokes and outside the inner circle; 16 bricks of another size are used to cover them. The remaining central part of the nave is radially divided into 8 parts and 8 bricks of still another type are employed to cover them. In this way, the total number of 200 (64 + 80 + 32 + 16 + 8) bricks of 9 different types are used. With the 7 types used for the first layer, and 9 for the second 16 different types of bricks are used to construct the fire-altar in the shape of a chariot wheel with spokes.

17.1-17.2. Fire-altars in the form of a trough (dronacit) are of two types, e.g., the square shaped and the circular, and both are used. In this chapter, the square type is described. 
17.3.-17.5. Measurement and construction. The body ABCD of the trough is a square of side 2 purușas or 320 ang. (Fig. 64). The handle (tsaru) EFGH is fixed at the middle of the western side BC of the body. It is a rectangle such that EF HG 70 ang. and FG

17.7. Placement of bricks in the first layer. 6 B, bricks are placed on each of BE and HC, that is, along line between the two western corners and the points where the handle meets the body. The remaining space can be filled with 172 Bys,-160 in the body and 12 in the handle including part of the body. In this way 12 B1s and 172 B2s, totalling 184 bricks, can be placed. The deficit of 16 bricks can be met by using Bås in place of B1s and B2s. According to Dvārakānātha, 4 B2s at the end of the handle are replaced by 4 B1s and 4 B ̧s and 12 B1s along BE and CH are replaced by 24 B,s. Now we have 4 B1s, 168 B2s and 28 B3s. (asmin prastāre catasraḥ ṣasthyaḥ | aṣṭaṣaṣṭisatamadhyardhāḥ | aṣṭāvimśatirardhyāḥ |--D.) 
17.8-17.12. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The method of placement is very clearly explained in these sutras and is shown in Fig. 65. After placing 2 Bås, one on each of the two eastern corners, 13 B1s can be placed on the eastern side of the body. 10 Bs are placed on each of the southern and the northern side. The tail contains 9 bricks, -2 B1s, 5 B2s and 2 B1s. The remaining space in the body can accommodate just 130 Bs. The total number of bricks thus used is as follows: B1-15; B2-137; B, 22; total 174. There is a deficit of 26 bricks, which is met by B, bricks. According to Dvårakånåtha, after replacement of B2s by B2s, the number of bricks of different types stands as follows : B1 
15; B2 124;

B2- - 39; and B-22; total - 200. Clearly 13 B2s are replaced by 39 Bås.

18.1-18.6. The construction of the fire-altar. For purposes of measurements, the ṣoḍaśī square bricks of area sq. pu. or 900 sq. ang. (that is, 30 × 30 sq. ang.) are employed. Clearly, 120 ṣoḍaśi bricks equal 122 or 71⁄2 sq. pu., the area of the fire- altar to be constructed. This area equals 108000 sq. ang. After deducting the area of 1 ṣoḍaśi brick of 900 sq. ang., the balance of 107, 100 sq. ang. is converted into a square of which the side obtained by taking the square root works out to.327 ang. 9 tila. Dvārakānātha gives this value as follows: tasya mulamāniya navatilasahita- saptavimśatyangulasahita-ŝatatrayāngulapramāṇena samacaturaśram kṛtvā 
The next step is to convert the above-mentioned square into a circle by the method given in sūtra Bśl. 2.9. and already applied in the case of the fire-altar in the form of the chariot wheel. Let ABCD be the square of side equal to 327 ang. 9 tila. (Fig. 66 ). EFGH is the ṣoḍāśi brick placed at the middle of the eastern side AD of the square. With O as centre and OM as radius a circle equal in area of the square ABCD is drawn, cutting EFGH by the curved line (dhanurvakrā) IJ. The 
222 
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA 
part of the sodasi brick IFGJ cut by the circle is transferred to the top of the remain- ing portion, as KEHL. Now, KIJL, whose area remains the same as that of a ṣoḍaśi brick, represents the handle of the circular trough (also called oṣṭha).

COMMENTARY 
Square bricks are made with side equal to 
223 
PQ, that is, 21 ang. 26 ti (= & 
of 261 ang. 6 ti), which is also the value given by the commentator (......tasya karanya dvādasena şaḍvimśati tilasahitenaikavimsatyangulena pramāneneṣṭakaḥ kuryat). The inscribed square PQRS is filled with 144 such bricks. 6 such bricks are placed in each of the four segments in the middle of, and touching, the square; 24 such bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is divided into 7 parts as shown in Fig. 67 (a), making their number 28. The brick in the centre of the segment in between the row of 6 bricks and the circumference of the circle is 30 ang. broad and is called pradhi madhyamā. With 2 bricks in the handle, as cut by the circle already described, the number of bricks in the first layer totals 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 corner bricks within the square by 4 half bricks of the one- twelfth type diagonally cut.

18.10-18.11. Arrangement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned such that the corners point towards intermediate directions Fig. 67(b). The square is filled with 144 one-twelfth bricks as before and 24 similar bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is also divided into 7 parts as in the first layer, making their number 28. To avoid overlapping of edges, the pradhi madhyamā brick is placed in the handle, and the space below is equally divided. The total number aggregates to 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 one-twelfth bricks in the square by 4 half bricks. 
Types of bricks. The sūtras do not specifically describe the types of bricks. From the descriptions, it is, however, clear that nine types of bricks are used. B1, B2, B3, B and B types are used in each segment; B, and B, in the handle; B。 is used in the centre of the segment in one layer; and B,s are used to complete the number 200. The following particulars of the bricks are based on the commentary (Fig. 68).

THE SAMUHYA AND THE PARICAYYA FIRE-ALTAR. 18.12-18.15. These sutras deal with samuhya and paricayya fire-altars. These altars are circular in shape and constructed in the same manner as the chariot wheel without spokes. The samūhya is not covered with bricks, but by loose earth dug out from pits, as stated in the sūtra. 
The paricayya is, however, covered with bricks in concentric circles. According to Dvārakānātha, 6 equally spaced concentric circles (agnikṣetre samāntarālāni ṣaṇmaṇ- dalāni) are drawn. The central circle, the nabhi, is divided into 8 equal parts. Beginning from the nābhi, the second and the third annular spaces are each divided into 16 equal parts; the fourth annular space is divided into 32 equal parts; and the fifth and the sixth annular spaces are each divided into 64 equal parts. In this way, 200 bricks are completed for the first layer. There are six different types of 
COMMENTARY 
225 
bricks, for the dimensions of radial divisions differ from one annular ring to the other (pratimaṇḍalam karaṇabhedaḥ | evam ṣaṭ karaṇāni). In the other layer, concentric circles are drawn in the middle of each annular ring and the inner circle (of the first layer) is removed. Here also we have 6 concentric circles but of different radii. The division of the nābhi and the succeeding annular rings is the same as before; but the radial lines are to be drawn such that these do not coincide with those of the first layer. All these are done to avoid the overlapping of edges. Here also 6 different types of bricks are used.

19.1-19.2. The fire-altar in the form of a pyre, as we shall presently see, is a trapezium. For its measurements and constructions as also for the bricks, a new unit has been introduced. Let p be this unit. According to rule 19.2,

The fire-altar is in the form of a trapezium ABCD, of which the western side BC is 2p units (= 170 ang. 12 tila), the eastern side AD is 3p ( 254 ang. + 16 tila) and the height, that is, the distance between AD and BC is 6p (509 ang. - - 2 tila) (Fig. 69). For the word trapezium, the word ekato'nimaddirghacaturaśra is used. It means a rectangle of which one side is shorter (than the opposite parallel side). The area of the trapezium is given by 
15 
2p × 6p + 2 × 6p = 15p2 = −2 sq. pu. = which satisfies the area of the agnikṣetra. 
71 sq. pu. 
First layer. For purposes of making the bricks, a rectangle ABCD is formed such that its length AB is 3p and breadth BC is 3p. From the mid-point E of AD, join EB, EC. EBC is an isosceles triangle (prauga) of area p2. 20 such praugas equal 15p2 or 7 sq. pu. and can be accommodated within the fire-altar. To attain the number 200, each such isosceles triangle is divided into 10 parts in the manner shown in Fig. 69(b). The sides EB, EC and BC are each divided into 4 equal parts by marking 3 equidistant points on each side. The points on the sides are joined with those on the base as shown, so as to obtain 4 isosceles triangles at the base and 6 double isosceles triangles above them. About the formation of such triangles, the commentator says: evam vibhakte pṛthvanikasthāḥ praugākārāścatasra iṣṭakāḥ | tatastisra ubhayataḥ praugākṛtayaḥ | tato dve | tata ekā cubukāntā | 
Regarding the placement of 20 isosceles triangles EBC of area ap2, a line EF is drawn in the middle of the body (Fig. 69a). In the eastern half, 11 such triangles can be placed, 6 with vertices turned west and 5 with vertices turned east. In

the western half, 9 such triangles can be accommodated, 5 with vertices turned west and 4 with vertices turned east. This represents the arrangement of bricks in which 80 praugas and 120 ubhayata praugas are used. 
19.5-19.7. Bricks and their placement in the second layer. The entire space of the fire-altar (agnikṣetra) can be divided into five large isosceles triangles of base p and height (from vertex to base) 6p. Three of them have their vertices turned towards west and the vertices of the two in between them are turned towards east. The two isosceles triangles, one on the southern side and the other on the northern, which have their vertices turned towards west, are bisected by perpendicular lines drawn from the vertex to the base (Fig. 71). The agnikṣetra is thus divided into three portions, (1) half isosceles triangle CDE on the southern side, (2) the half isosceles triangle BAF on the northern side, and (3) the rectangle BCEF in the middle. Note that, since ED and AF are each ≥þ, EF

2p. 
To make the different types of bricks, the half isosceles triangle on either side is divided into six parts (Fig. 70). AB, BC and AC are divided into three equal parts each by the points, a, b, c, d, e, and f. Join bc, ad, de and cgf. The space is thus divided into 3 half isosceles triangles Bbc, cdg and dce which constitute the first type of brick B1. Note that Bb = 2p, bc = g. Through the above division, we get the second type B2, the rectangular bricks abcg, Aagƒ and fgde, of which the sides are 2p and p . The third type B, called the bṛhati, is a rectangular brick ABCD (Fig. 70(b)), of which AB p and AD p. The fourth type B is half bṛhati (Fig. 70(c)), a rectangular brick measuring p/4 by p/6.

The arrangement of bricks in the second layer is shown in Fig. 71. 3B1s and 3 B2s are placed in each of the two half-isosceles parts of the fire-altar. 8 B1s are placed on the eastern and the western parts each of the rectangular part of the fire- altar, with the longer side turned north-south. (Note that 2p/p = 8). These two rows use up up and the remaining vertical distance is (6p—g) — 172. The remaining space in the rectangular part of the fire-altar can be divided into 17 horizontal and 8 vertical rows in which 136 B bricks can be fitted with their longer sides turned east. Thus, the number of bricks used in this way totals as follows : 
B1 
6; B2 6 ; Bз 
3

136; B4- 16; total 
164. 
There is still a deficit of 36 bricks. According to the commentator, the deficit can be met by replacing 36 B, bricks (9 from each of the 4 corners) by 72 B1s. Dvārakā- nātha says: pārśvayorupahitapraugārdhayordvādaśeṣṭakāḥ | madhyabhūtacaturaśra (pūrvā) parāntayoḥ ṣoḍaśārdheṣṭakāḥ | madhye şaṭtrimsacchalam bṛhatyaḥ prāgāyatāḥ | evam catuḥṣaṣṭi satamiṣṭakaḥ ṣaṭtrimśannyūnā bhavanti | śronyamseṣu nava nava bṛhatiścaturasrakṛtā uddhṛtyāṣṭādaśāṣṭāḍaśārdhyā nidheyāḥ | evam dviśataḥ prastārāḥ | 
19.9-19.11. These sūtras deal with the height of the fire-altars and do not call for much comment.

CHAPTER 20 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A TORTOISE 
(KŪRMACIT)—FIRST TYPE WITH TWISTED LIMBS 
20.1-20.2. Fire-altars in the form of a tortoise are of two types, (1) the tortoise with twisted limbs (vakrāngāḥ) and (2) the tortoise with rounded limbs (parimaṇḍalāḥ). The construction of the first type is described in this chapter.

20.3-20.7. The construction of the fire-altar. A square of side 10 prakamas or 300 ang is first constructed and the four corners are cut off by 30 ang (that is, an isosceles tri- angle of two equal sides, each 30 ang is removed from each corner. A B C D E F G H is the shape of the body thus obtained (Fig. 72). Note that AB CD EF HG 60√2 ang. and BC DE FG AH = 180 ang. Four squares, each of side 30 ang. are placed side by side in contact with the middle of the eastern side of the body AH. Outer halves of the two side squares are diagonally cut off so as to get the figure a b c d. Note that ab equals 60 ang. Similar figures are constructed in the middle of the other three sides of the body BC, DE and FG.

The head is constructed by placing a rectangle on ab (ab of which length or height is 75 ang; the two eastern corners are then cut off by 30 ang each so as to get the shape efabg for the head. 
For each foot, a rectangle 30√2 ang. broad by 60√2 ang long is placed in the middle of the cut off corner, say on HG for the south-east corner. Thereupon, the eastern corner of this rectangle is cut off by 30√2 ang so as to obtain hijk for the shape of the foot. Similar constructions are made upon EF, CD and AB to build the remaining feet.

20.12-20.15. The placement of bricks in the first layer. As per sūtras, 1B, is to be placed at the tip of the head and below it 2 B5s (Fig. 73). In each foot 5 Bes and 2 B2s are placed as shown in the figure. In the remaining space, B2s are placed wherever the corners are cut diagonally and B1s in the rest. Clearly, the number 200 cannot be arrived at in this way; so B1s are replaced by Bos as necessary. According to the commentary, this can be done in the following way. Excluding the feet, the whole space of the fire-altar can be divided into 12 vertical rows, 6 on the southern side of the line passing through the centre of the body and the tip of the head and 6 on its northern side. In the first 6 rows from the southernmost one, the arrang ement is as follows :-

With B at the tip of the head, the total comes to 199. So the commentator observes that to complete the number and for the sake of symmetry B at the tip is replaced by 2Bgs (śirasi sūtroktām caturaśreṣṭakāmuddhṛtyāntadirghapārśve pādeṣṭake nidadhyāt ().

Thus there is a deficit of 41 bricks (ekacatvāriṛśadūnāḥ). This deficit is met by replac ing 40 B1s (5B,s from each of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th rows of each of the southern and the northern halves of the agnikṣetra) by 80 Bs.

as 
21.2-21-4. The construction. Here the method of construction is the same that already described in the case of the circular trough (chapter 18). We have seen that 120 sodasi bricks equal 71⁄2 sq. pu. 5 ṣoḍaśi bricks are taken out and the area of the remaining 115 ṣoḍaśis (103500 sq. ang.) is turned into a square of side 321 ang. 24 ti (the commentator's value is 321 ang. 25 ti). This square is transformed into a circle of the same area as per Bśl. 2.9. In this act of circling the square, each of the 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks is cut by the circle and the western portion transferred to the eastern side. In this way, each of the 5 şoḍasi bricks is rounded off, one of them forms the head and the remaining 4 are attached to the circle in the 4 intermediate directions (Fig. 75). 
The next step is to draw within the circle a square of the maximum possible area. The side of the inscribed square, as we have calculated, works out to 256 ang. 25 ti. 
21.5-21.9. The side of the inscribed square, 256 ang. 25 ti is divided into 12 equal parts, and squared bricks are formed with side equal to each such part, that is, 21 ang. 13 ti which agrees with the value of the commentator (trayodaŝatilasahitaika- vimsatyanguleneṣṭakaḥ). But the commentator's value of 255 ang. 19 ti for the side of the inscribed square is inaccurate inasmuch as it leads to 21 ang. and 10 ti as the side of the square brick and not 21 ang. 13 ti as mentioned.
