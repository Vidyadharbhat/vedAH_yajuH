The same sūtra is also given by Āpastamba (Ãśl. 1.6) and Kâtyāyana (Kśl. 2.9).
In decimal fraction, the above value of √2 = 1.4142156. According to modern calculation, √2 = 1.4142135. Thus it is clear that the ancient Indians attained a remarkable degree of accuracy in calculating an approximate value of √2. The śulbakāras gave methods, for constructing a square equal to the sum of two equal squares, but gave no method of calculating the value of its diagonal.
Thibaut, Rodet, Datta, and others gave possible methods of solution for arri- ving at the value as follows:-
(i) Thibaut's proof.a
Now, 172 2.122
1. Thibaut argued, by how much the side 17 must be diminished in order that the square on it may be 2.122 exactly. Since 2 × 17 ×

In Baudhāyana's selection of units of 12 angulas (= 1 pada) and 34 tilas 1 angula) Thibaut found justification for the choice of the arbitrary relation 172 = 2.122 (approx.) leading to the origin of the formula of √2, as given in the
text.
(ii) Rodet's approximation.b
According to Rodet, the approximation adopted by śulbakāras may be obtained by successive approximation.

The methods described later by Gurjara and Guptab are the same and no improvement over Rodet's method.
(iii) Datta's proof.c
Datta's proof is an improvement over that of Thibaut and maintains the method of construction followed in the ŝulba.
The method consists in constructing a square with area equal to the sum of the areas of the two other squares having sides of one unit in length (Fig.. 25).

For this one of the two squares having side of unit length is divided into three equal parts by lines drawn parallel to one of its sides. Each of these parts forms a rectangular piece of one unit in length and one-third unit in width. Two of these rectangular parts are then joined length-wise to the two adjacent sides of the other unit square. This leaves a square hole at one of the corners of the enlarged unit

Value of √2 in other culture areas.
A small cuneiform tablet (Yale Babylonian collection No. 7289) of the old Babylonian times (c. 1800--1600 B.C.) shows a square with its two diagonals, with three numbers in sexagesimal system inscribed on it. These three numbers are interpreted by Neugebauera as the value of the diagonal, a side and the value of √2 (since d = √2 a). Here √2 is given as 1, 24, 51, 10, which in terms of decimals comes out to be 1.41421,291....
......"
a little more accurate than the Indian value. The Indian value is smaller while the Babylonian value larger than the actual value. Moreover, their first fractional terms are different. The suggestion that the Indian value might have been obtained from a Babylonian source is groundless. As regards Greek sources, many approximations to the value of √Z are known, but not a value of this order of accuracy.
Irrationality of √2.
Baudhāyana, Āpastamba and Kātyāyana gave the value of √/2, as mentioned above, with an additional term viśeșa (approximate). Many scholars expressed doubt whether, by the term viseṣa, the śulbakāras recognized the irrationality of √2. According to Karavindasvāmi," a commentator on the Āpastambaśulbasūtra, the root sis when prefixed by vi denotes in all cases a 'correction in excess'. Dattad has discussed the matter in detail, and the commentator can be relied upon in this interpretation. Looking into the ancient literature of India, we find in the early canonical works of the Jainas many instances of the employment of the term viśeṣa in the same connection as we find in the śulba. A few instances are given here.

and a little over (kiñcid-viśeṣādhika) (Sūrya-prajñapati, sūtra 20).
(ii) The diameter is 100000 yojanas, circumference is 316227 yojanas 3 gavyutis 128 dhanus 13 angulas and a little over (kiñchid-viseṣādhika) (Jambudvipa- prajñapti, sutra 3).
Hence viseșa refers to a small quantity, which is either in excess or in deficit, and cannot be accurately determined. Šulbakāras gave no proof for it, since it was beyond
their tradition.
CHAPTER 3
POSITIONS, RELATIVE DISTANCES AND AREAS OF SACRIFICIAL FIRES AND ALTARS
This and the following four chapters 4-7 deal with the positions, relative distances, and areas of various sacrificial fires and altars as also the types of bricks used in the construction of some of them. For a fuller appreciation of the details of mensuration presented by the sulbakāras in these chapters, a general idea regarding the plan of the sacrificial ground and the various fires and altars mentioned will be helpful. These details have been given at various places of the Brāhmaṇas, parti- cularly of the Yajurveda school. Karavinda, the commentator of the Apastamba-Šulba- sūtra has also made available a good summary.
PLAN OF THE SACRIFICIAL GROUND
The place for worship and performance of the various sacrificial rites is selected where the ground is high, even and firm, inclining towards the east or the north and rising towards the south.a It should be spacious enough for the laying of the sacrificial hall, the mahāvedi and various pits, structures and elements required. After drawing the east-west line in the sacrificial ground, the sacrificial hall, the prācina-vamśa or prāgvamsa, as called by Baudhāyana, Kātyāyana and others, is erected at the western end, lying along, and symmetrically about, the east-west line (Fig. 26). The name is derived from the use of horizontal beams (vamŝa) supported by four corner posts, on which corner beams are fastened to serve as lintels of the eastern and western doors.b In this hall, besides the priests, the members of the family and friends of the person performing the sacrifice can assemble.
Inside this sacrificial hall are set up the gārhapatya fire at the western end, the āhavaniya fire at the eastern, the dakṣiṇāgni on the southern side more towards west and the utkara on the northern side more towards east. In between the āhavaniya

BAUDHAYANA-SULBASŪTRA
and the gārhapatya fire is placed the dārśapaurṇamāsika altar for the full-moon sacrifice or such other altars as may be required.
The garhapatya is the householder's fire received from his father and transmitted to his descendants. It is a perpetual sacred fire from which other sacrificial fires are lighted. This fire is used by the priests for cooking oblations. The āhavaniya is a consecrated fire taken from the householder's perpetual fire and is also used for cooking oblations. The dakṣiņāgni, also called by the name of anvāhārya-pacana, is used for cooking food. Eggeling says that, at the new-and full-moon sacrifice, the anvāhārya mess of rice, the priest's dakṣiņā, is cooked at this fire. The utkara placed near the north-east side of the sacrificial hall is a rubbish pit dug out in the ground.
East of the prāgvaṛśa and separated by a narrow space, the mahāvedi or the saumiki vedi (the soma altar) is placed symmetrically about the east-west (prācī) line. This is a trapezium measuring 30 units on the western side, 24 on the eastern side and 36 units east-west along the spine. The setting up of the mahāvedi is descri- bed in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa as follows (Eggeling's translation)b:
"1. From the post which is the largest on the east side (of the hall) he now strides three steps forwards (to the east), and there drives in a peg,—this is the intermediate (peg).
2. From the middle peg he strides fifteen steps to the right, and there drives
in a peg,-this is the right hip.
3. From the middle peg he strides fifteen steps northwards, and there drives
in a peg,—this is the left hip.
4. From that middle peg he strides thirty-six steps eastwards, and there drives
in a peg, this is the fore-part.
5. From the middle peg (in front) he strides twelve steps to the right, and
there drives in a peg,—this is the right shoulder.
6. From the middle peg he strides twelve steps to the north, and there drives
in a peg, this is the left shoulder. This is the measure of the altar."
After the area of the mahāvedi is thus marked out, the sadas tent is erected near the western base of the mahāvedi. The tent is rectangular in area, the longer side lying south-north symmetrically about the east-west line, and is provided with doors on the western and the eastern side. This tent is reserved for the priests to sit

and conduct various operations:- "And because all the gods sat (sad) in it there- fore it is called sadas—and so do these Brāhmaṇas of every family now sit therein.”a Clearly the tent is divided by the prăci line into two parts. In the middle of it, a post of udumbara wood (Fiscus glomerata) is fixed to the ground.
Inside the sadas, six dhiṣnya hearths, Dh, are prepared. These are subordinate or side altars, generally a heap of earth covered with sand on each of which a fire is placed. There are actually eight dhiṣnyas, of which two, e.g., the āgnidhra and the mārjālīya are placed outside the sadas as will be seen in what follows. Of these six hearths placed in the tent, five are placed on the northern part parallel to the east side and belong, in order from the south to the (1) Hoty, (2) Brāhmaṇācchamsi, (3) Potr, (4) Neştṛ, and (5) Acchāvāka. The dhiṣṇya hearth belonging to the Maitrā- varuṇa or Praśāstṛ priest is placed on the southern half of the tent near the east side.
The two other dhisnya hearths, e.g. the āgnidhra, Āg, and the mārjāliya, M, are placed in the middle part of the northern and the southern side respectively of the mahāvedi. Both these hearths are set up under square sheds with four posts erected over them, open on the east side and the side facing the havirdhāna cart-shed in the middle of the altar. The Brāhmaṇa says: "In the north-with regard to the back part of the Soma-carts-he then raises the āgnidhra (shed). One half of it should be inside the altar, and one half outside; or more than one half may be inside the altar and less outside; or the whole of it may be inside the altar... "e Āgnidhra is the sacred fire and is to be thrown up first. The mārjāliya is a heap of earth on which sacrificial vessels are cleansed and is the last to be thrown up.
In the middle region of the mahāvedi, east of the sadas and in line with the āgnidhra and the mārjāliya, the havirdhāna shed, H, is erected. This is the shed for the Soma-cart used for carrying soma plants to the sacrificial ground. Regarding the derivation of the name, the Brāhmaṇa says: ‘And because Soma is therein-Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods-therefore it is called Havirdhāna (receptacle of havis)'.d The cart-shed is provided with doors on the eastern and the western side and possibly on the southern and northern sides. Regarding the construction of the cart-shed, Eggeling, following Sayana and Katyayana, explains that, in front of the carts and behind them, beams are driven into the ground, six on each side. The two middle ones, one cubit north and south of the prăci line respectively, forming a gateway on each side. On these two rows of beams other beams are laid, running from south to north, and forming, as it were, the lintels of the gates; the tie beams running west-east rest on them. This frame of timber is to form a square of nine (or ten) cubits. Mats of seed-grass are spread over the tie beams.

Uparavas are sounding holes dug out in the ground near the havirdhāna. The soma plants are ground over this hole, emitting the sound of the grinding stone, which gave it the name. The exact location of these sounding holes is not clear. The Satapatha Brāhmaṇa says: 'He digs just beneath the fore-part of the shafts of the southern cart.'a Karavinda says that the uparavas are located in the south-west corner of the southern part of the cart-shed,—dakṣiṇahavirdhānasya dakṣiṇaśroṇyāmu- paravāḥ.
The uttara vedi, UV, is raised near the eastern side of the mahāvedi, with the prāci line passing through its middle. It literally means 'higher or upper altar' and so is likened to the nose of the sacrificer: 'That high altar (uttara vedi) is the nose oft he sacrificer; because they throw it up so as to be higher than the altar, therefore it is called 'high altar'. The altar is built with the earth dug out of the cātvāla pit. This cātvāla pit is dug out at a little distance towards north from the north-east corner of the mahāvedi. The Brāhmaṇa says: "....and from where the northern peg of the front side is, he strides three steps backwards and there marks off the pit (cātvāla).'¢ It is of the same measure as that of the uttara vedi. Karavinda's comments on the cātvāla is as follows: uttarasmādvedyamsādudakprakrame cātvāla uttaravedisammitaḥ. West of the cātvāla is the rubbish heap utkara, U. Eggeling has observed that the exact distance of the cātvāla is left to the discretion of the Adhvaryu priest, provided it is in front of the utkara and a narrow passage is left between them. He also says that the cātvāla pit should be contiguous to the north edge of the large altar, that is, the mahāvedi.
DISTANCE AND RELATIVE POSITION OF GARHAPATYA, AHAVANIYA, DAKṢIŅĀGNI
AND UTKARA
3.1-3.5 According to Baudhayana, the āhavaniya is constructed at a distance of 8 prakramas from the garhapatya fire, when it is made by 4 Brāhmaṇas. The distance is sometimes 11 or 12 prakramas for peoples other than the Brāhmaṇas and followed traditionally from the time of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (Śat. Br. I. 7.3. 23-25). For finding the relative positions of garhapatya, āhavaniya and dakṣiṇāgni fires, Baudhāyana has prescribed the following three methods :
First method.
Let A,G, and D stand for āhavaniya, gārhapatya and dakṣiņāgni fires. The distance AG is divided into three equal parts, and with each third part, three squares are drawn touching each other; then the north-west corner of the western square, south- east corner of the same square and north-east corner of the eastern square mark the places for gārhapatya, dakṣiṇāgni and āhavaniya fires respectively (Fig. 27). When A and G are interchanged the corresponding position of D i.e. U will denote the place for utkara. Kātyāyana has given a similar method for fixing the positions of A, G, D and U (vide Kśl. 1.11).

DARŚAPAURṆAMĀSIKA VEDI
3.6-3.8. The dārŝapaurṇamāsika vedi is placed towards the west side of the ahavaniya and is in the form of an isosceles trapezium having face equal to 48 angulas, base 64 angulas and altitude 96 angulas.
Here AD: = 48 angulas
BC 64 angulas
and EW 96 angulas.
A cord of length 2 BC is taken and a mark is given at its middle. Two ends of the cord are fixed at the southern poles A and B and is stretched towards south by the middle mark and a pole is fixed at it. Fixing two ends of the cord at this pole an arc is drawn through AB by the middle mark of the cord. Similar arcs are drawn in other sides. This is the vedi (Fig. 28).
This has been referred to in Ã§l. 4.5 and Mśl. 1.4. The vedi has a long tradition and is mentioned in the Taittiriya Samhita (II. 6.4. 2-3) and Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa (III. 2.9. 10).
PASUBANDHA AND UTTARA Vedi
3.9-3.10. The paŝubandha vedi is in the form of an isosceles trapezium whose face equals 8 padas, base 10 padas and altitude 12 padas. Sometimes the vedi is measured by akṣa, iṣā and yuga units of a chariot. The uttara vedi according to Baudhayana is a square pit of side 10 padas.
PAITṚKI VEDI
3.11. The paitṛki vedi is a square altar and its four corners are placed in four cardinal directions viz. east, west, north and south. The side of the paitṛki vedi is one-third of the units in mahāvedi, which is an isosceles trapezium of 972 sq. padas, having its face of 24 padas, base 30 padas and altitude 36 padas. Hence the corres- ponding units in paitṛki vedi are 8, 10, 12 and its area 1 (8 + 10) × 12
108 sq. padas. This justifies Baudhāyana's statement that the paitṛki vedi is one-ninth in area of the mahāvedi.
-
Again, when one-third of the mahāvedi (i.e. sautrāmaṇiki vedi) is turned into a square, its side becomes 18 padas (Bśl. 3.12). Baudhāyana says in this rule that the
side of the paityki vedi is. This is also quite proper, for by the first method the
18
side of the paitṛki vedi equals √108 or
18
Kātyāyana, however, prescribes that in a square ABCD of 2 sq. purusas, the figure obtained by joining the middle poles E, G, W, H, that is the figure EGWH will be the required paitṛki vedi. The area EGWH is undoubtedly a square of 1 sq.
176
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
puruşa (Fig. 29). Here again the area varies from that of Baudhayana but agrees with that of Apastamba (Ãśl. 6.7-6.8). Though there is some difference in area, it is, however, a fact that the paitṛki vedi is a square pointing towards the cardinal directions.
SAUTRĀMAŅIKI VEDI
3.12. The rule of Baudhāyana suggests that the Sautrāmaņiki vedi may be a square of 18 padas or an isosceles trapezium whose area is one-third of that of mahā- vedi, having area of 972 sq. padas. Baudhāyana made no explicit mention of how to construct an isosceles trapezium similar to a given isosceles trapezium but with
1 √3
one-third of its area. Āpastamba (Ãśl. 5.8) constructed it with of the units used
in mahāvedi or 8√3 and 10√3 as face and base and 12√3 as altitude. The mahāvedi is an isosceles trapezium having face 24, base 30 and altitude 36 units. Hence

the sautrāmaṇikī vedi is an isosceles trapezium of face

This equals one-third the area of a mahāvedi. The same method is also given by Katyāyana (Kśl. 2.11-2.12).

The uparavā is a square of side 12 ang. or a circle of radius 6 ang. drawn within a square of side 24 ang. Two uparavās are generally placed together at a distance of 12 angulas.
The rites and ceremonies in connection with the construction of the above and various other altars are commonly found in the Taittiriya Samhitā and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, but any clear mention of their special magnitudes is very rare.
Baudhayana has made categorical mention of spatial magnitudes besides the methods of construction here and there (Bśl. 7.9, Ãśl. 7.2.). Baudhayana has discussed the construction of the mahāvedi in the next rule. Āpastamba has spe- cially treated the dimension, area and construction of mahāvedi (or saumiki vedi) in chapter 5 of his Apastamba-sulbasūtra. The mahāvedi has much older tradition and its method of construction is mentioned in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (IX. 2.1.4).
As regards relative distance of other vedis within the mahāvedi it is known from the Baudhāyana sulba that the sadas is at a distance of 1 prakrama (or pada) from the
178
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASUTRA
western side of the mahāvedi, and the havirdhāna at a distance of 4 prakramas (or padas) from it, and in the eastern side of the havirdhana, 9 prakramas (or padas) still remain. Hence the relative distance is 1 + 10 (sadas) + 4 + 12 (havirdhāna) + 9 (rest) 36. According to Manava (Msl. 3.1-3.3), this is 1 + 9 (sadas) + 4 + 12 + 10 36. In this connection it is important to note that the altitude of the mahāvedi is 36.

USE OF EKĀDASINI IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAHAVEDI and Aśvamedha Vedi
4.12-4.14. In ekādasini vedi there are 11 posts arranged in a row, each placed at a distance of 1 akṣa from its immediate next. The diameter of each hole in which the pole is placed is a pada, and a space of 4 ang. is left on both sides of the two end-poles. Hence the space covered equals 10 akṣa + 11 padas + 8 ang. that is,
1213 ang. For the construction of the eastern part (i.e. face) of the mahāvedi with 11 poles, the length of 1213 ang. is divided by 24 to calculate the value of each prakrama. The distance between the two poles is known as prakrama. The length of prakrama varies for enlarged altars. For this reason the length of prakrama in mahāvedi is different from that of aśvamedha vedi. Since the face of the mahāvedi is 24 prakramas, according to Dvårakānātha, one prakrama equals
10x 104 11 x 15 + 4
24
50 ang. 18 tilas (approx.).
According to Kātyāyana (Kśl. 6.8-6.13), it is the 24th part of 11 paravăn, 10 akṣa that is, 48 ang. 28 tilas (Mahidhara). Kâtyāyana has not considered any space left beyond the two-poles. Mahidhara has suggested 1 paravan to be 12 ang.; the pada according to Baudhāyana is 15 ang., while it is 12 ang. in other exts.
pada
Fig. 30.
The east-west line (prāci) of the mahāvedi is likewise constructed with 11 poles. Only a rectangular block of half a pada is cut off from the eastern side of the altar and the end-pole is placed, so that half of the end-pole is to be considered inside the altar and half outside. For construction of east-west line, the extra 8 ang. that is left beyond the end-poles discussed above is not required in this case.
For the construction of the aśvamedha vedi, by the use of 21 poles, the value of each prakrama is taken to be 24th part of 20 akṣa + 21 padas + 8 ang. which is
20 × 104 + 21 × 15 + 8 equal to
= 100 ang 4 tilas (approx.). 24

ENLARGEMENT OF FIRE-ALTAR FROM 71⁄2 SQ. PURUSAS TO 1011 SQ.PURUSAS, HEIGHT OF ALTARS AND THEIR PECULIARITIES
ENLARGED FIRE-ALTAR AND UNITS
5.1-5.6. The fire-altar of the first construction has an area of 71 sq. purușas. This has been discussed in subsequent chapters. The second construction has 8 sq. purusas, and according to Baudhāyana, it is increased by one square puruşa successi- vely from 7 sq. purușas to 1011 sq. purușas. There is a mention of this type of

increment upto 101 sq. purusas in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇaa. When the fire-altar is increased from the original 7 sq. purusas by p square purusas, Baudhāyana says, the increment in each purușa equals the side of a square of 1 +

that is, 7+ p. sq. purușas (Bśl. 5.6).
With this length as unit of measure, the altar is constructed in the same manner
2p as in original falcon-shaped altar. For obtaining the portion, Baudhāyana perhaps divided the extra area into 15 equal parts by drawing 15 parallel lines or by drawing 3 parallel lines in one side and 5 parallel lines on the other after p square areas were turned into a square. Then two of these rectangular pieces were combined together with the help of samāsavidi.
13
Both Apastamba (Ãśl. 8.6) and Kātyāyana (Kśl. 5.5) have given the same value of Baudhāyana, which equals the side of a square of (71 + p) sq. purușas (where p 1 sq. puruṣa). Kātyāyana has given the same value of enlarged sq. unit in two other forms as follows:

This method of Kåtyāyana is known as the method of increment by puruşa (puruṣābhyāsa—Kśl. 5.4).
Moreover, Apastamba has devised a method of joining complete purușas in the body, wings and tail. If the increased area of p purușas be an exact mutiple or sub- multiple of the original agni, i.e. p = q×74, then the new unit comes out to be √l + q. This is known as increment on the whole posts (sarvabhyāsa, Ast. 21.7).
In the enlargement of the falcon-shaped fire-altar (first plan) let s be the enlarged unit in purușa and p the total increment in area. Then in the form of a quadratic equation this can be written as
body+2 wings + tail = 7+ p

The principle of enlargement of agni by increasing the length of the unit of measure was known in the time of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.a It has described the construction of the agni of 101 sq. purușa, where 14 or 14 times enlarged unit in purușa is taken up for its construction.b
HEIGHT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT LAYERS OF ALTAR AND BRICKS
5.7-7.3. In the usual five-layer construction, the height of the altar is 32 ang., height of each layer being 32 ang. (Bśl. 5.7 and 7.2). According to Karavindasvāmī, it is 6 ang. Actually two layers are constructed. Construction of other layers is not required, since the 3rd and the 5th layer are the replica of the 1st and the 4th that of the 2nd. In the placement of bricks in different layers clefts between two layers are avoided. An altar of daily fire like the gārhapatya has 21 bricks in each layer, while a kāmya fire-altar is constructed with 1000 bricks, each layer containing 200 bricks. A fire-altar of 71 sq. purușas is the normal construction. Pañcacoḍā and nākasat bricks have half the thickness of ordinary bricks; hence one pañcacoḍā and one nāksat taken together are considered as one brick (Bśl. 5.17 and 7.2). They are usually on the fifth layer placed at the top. The spoiled or broken bricks or bricks of black colour are not used in the construction ( Bśl. 7.1).
Usually all the fire-altars from 14 sq. purușas (one fold) to 101 sq. purușas (101 fold) are not constructed. In some cases they are constructed without wings and tails. In the construction of fire-altars from 8 to 101 sq. purușas, how the units in sq. purusas are proportionately increased has been discussed. After all these are not normal constructions and are done in the construction for second and third time. In the second and third construction the fire-altar is constructed with more bricks and increased height. As regards its height and the number of bricks to be used in its construction, the Taittiriya Samhitā writes: "He should pile (the fire) of a thousand (bricks) when first piling (it); this world is commensurate with a thousand; verily he conquers this world. He should pile (it) of two thousands, when piling a second time, the atmosphere is commensurate with two thousands; verily he

conquers the atmosphere. He should pile (it) of three thousands, verily he conquers yonder world. Knee-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the first time, verily with the gayatri he mounts this world; naval-deep should he pile it when piling for the second time, verily with the triṣṭubh, he mounts the atmosphere; neck-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the third time, verily with the jagati, he mounts the yonder world".a (Keith's translation).
The fire-altar (Chapter 6) has the characteristics of an animal. The head of the animal lies in the east and its back is compared with the east-west line. The east-west line is the central line of the altar and measurements are given with reference to this central east-west line. The bricks marked for south and north are placed accordingly on the southern and northern side of the altar. Diagrams of circle, a bull, a woman without ears, line, darbha grass are depicted on the bricks for their use for specific purposes. The bricks with different markings and symbols are also mentioned by Mānava in Chapter 7 of his Mānava-śulbasūtra.
CONSTRUCTION OF GARHAPATYA FIRE-ALTAR (SQUARE).
7.4-7.7. Baudhāyana says the garhapatya fire-altar has the form of a square according to one tradition and of a circle according to another. The area is always one sq. vyāyāma. It is constructed with 21 bricks in each layer. For the placing of bricks in the square garhapatya, the following two methods are adopted.
First Method.
One side of the square is divided into 3 parts by drawing 3 parallel lines and the other into 7 parts by drawing 7 parallel lines. These lines divide the square area into 21 rectangles and the bricks are accordingly made. This is for the first layer. For the second layer, the bricks are arranged differently in the square.
Second Method.
Three kinds of square bricks are made with 6th, 4th and 3rd part of a vyāyāma. The first layer is prepared with 9 bricks of the first kind and 12 bricks of the second, and the second layer with 6 bricks of the third kind and 16 bricks of the first.
How the ancient altar builders determined the size of the bricks of different kinds and the number of bricks of each kind required for the construction of each layer is not known. The solution was obtained possibly on the following line.
Empirical Method.
Suppose the sides of the three new types of bricks be p, q, and r th part of a vyāyāma, where p, q, r are rational integers. The minimum number of bricks must be three, since in each layer there are two types of square bricks and no two layers have identical arrangement of bricks.

Putting 9 1, 2, 3, 4, the values of p can be determined by trial, considering the value of x to be integral.
CONSTRUCTION OF GARHAPATYA FIRE-ALTAR (CIRCULAR)
7.8. For construction of a circular gārhapatya a square ABCD as large as possi- ble is inscribed within a circle (Fig. 31) Āpastamba has directed that with half a vyāyāma as radius this circle is to be drawn; the end points of two diameters standing at right-angles to each other when joined give the largest possible square (Āsl. 7.5.).
184
BAUDHÃYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
The square ABCD is then divided into 9 equal parts by 3 parallel lines from one side and 3 from the other side, and each segment is divided into 3 equal parts. Hence the whole circle is divided into 21 parts and the bricks are accordingly made for the first layer.

Baudhāyana and Apastamba have considered the problem of quadrature of the circle whose area falls short of the circle.

7.9-7.17. The dhisnya has one layer only. It may be a square or Generally it is covered with sand on which the fire is placed.
a circle.
The agnidhriya may also be a square or a circle. When it is in the form of a square, it is divided into nine small squares, and the central brick is replaced by a piece of stone. The same method is also given by Manava (Mśl. 6.10). When it is circular, a round stone of 8 angulas diameter is placed in the centre of the circle and the remaining area divided into eight equal parts (Fig. 32).
The mārjāliya is divided into 3 equal parts by lines parallel to the north-south line. The eastern and western parts together are divided into 5 parts. No detail is available in the Baudhāyana fulba as to how the eastern or western part is to be divided. The commentator Dvārakānātha gives the idea of dividing the eastern slab into two and western slab into three parts. Mānava has, however, suggested different constructions (Mśl. 6.11). The mārjāliya, when circular, is divided into six equal parts.
The chandaścit is the fire-altar of mantras, not of bricks. The shape of the fire-altar is drawn on the ground and the whole ceremony performed. Instead of placing bricks, the sacrificer only touches the places on which the bricks are to be placed and mutters the same mantras at the appropriate time.

CHAPTER 8
CONSTRUCTION OF A RECTILINEAR ŚYENACIT—FIRST TYPE
8.1.-8.5. Baudhayana, Āpastamba and other ŝulbakāras have considered the construc- tion of two categories of falcon-shaped fire-altars. e.g. (a) the first category in which the body, the wings and the tail are rectilinear (squares and rectangles), and (b) the second category in which the wings are curved, the tail is spread out, and the body and the head have their corners cut off. In the latter case the shape of the altar more closely resembles the falcon.
The sūtra 8.4 is taken from the Taittiriya Samhitā which runs as follows : pañca dakṣiṇāyāṁ śroṇyāmupadadhāti | pañcottarasyāṁ tasmāt paścādvarṣiyān purastāt pravaṇaḥ pasubasto vaya iti dakṣine'msa upadadhāti | vṛṣṇirvaya ityuttare❜msāveva pratidadhāti | vyāghro vaya iti dakṣine pakṣa upadadhāti | simhovaya ityuttare pakṣayoreva vīryam dadhāti | purușo vaya iti madhye tasmāt puruṣaḥ paśunāmadhipatiḥa |
The construction of the fire-altar after the shadow cast on the ground by a flying bird is also given in the same Brāhmaṇa as follows: vayasām vā eṣa pratimayā ciyate yadagniryannyāñcam cinuyātb
In this chapter, a simple rectilinear syenacit is discussed.
8.6-8.7. Bricks. The following four types of square bricks are used for the construction:
2
B1-one-fourth brick B2-one-fifth brick B-one-sixth brick B-one-tenth brick
(caturthi) —30× 30 sq. angulas. (pañcami)—-24 × 24 sq. añgulas. (şaşṭhi) -20 × 20 sq. añgulas. (dasami) -12 x 12 sq. angulas.
8.8-8.10. Measurement of the fire-altar. In this fire-altar, the body (atman) is a square and the two wings and the tail are rectangles. To set up these rectilinear figures of required areas on the ground, one can use either a cord or a bamboo rod and follow the rules of construction of such figures discussed in chapters 1 and 2. For measure- ment with a bomboo rod with a hole at either end and at the middle, Āpastamba has given greater details which are considered in our notes to Ãśl. 9.1-9.3.
The body is a square of 4 sq. pu., that is, of side 2 pu. or 240 ang. At the middle of its southern and northern side, a rectangle each, measuring 144 angulas × 120 angulas, with the longer side drawn south-north, is set up; this will represent the south and the north wing. A rectangle of 132 añgulas × 120 angulas, with the longer side towards east-west, attached to the middle of the western side of the body, is the tail (Fig. 33). The area of the altar is :

8.11-8.13. Placement of bricks in the first layer. Starting with the south wing,4 B2 bricks flanked on either side by 2 B bricks are placed in a row, east-west, at a distance of 40 angulas from the end of the wing (Fig. 33). Dvārakānātha explains purușatṛtiya- velāyām as catvārimŝadangulapramāṇavelāyāmatītāyām. Then 8 B1s are placed in two rows, leaving a space which can be filled exactly by 18 B, bricks. In this way, 34 bricks can be placed in the south wing (evam pakṣe catustrimsadiṣṭakaḥ. The northern wing is covered in the same way starting with the northern end.

In the tail, as per direction of the rule, 8 B1s can be placed, —4 on the eastern and 4 on the western side, 12 B1s-6 on the southern and 6 on the northern side, and 12 B2s in the remaining space in the middle, accounting for 32 bricks (pucche dvātrimśat-D.). Rule 8.12 also directs the filling up of the body with B, bricks, and clearly enough 100 B2s can be accommodated in a square 240 × 240 sq. añgulas (ātmani śatam—D.). The number and types of bricks used in different parts of the fire-altar are shown in Table 1, in agreement with Dvārakānātha's enumeration (caturthyaścaturvimsatiḥ | pañcamyo vimŝatyadhikam satam | sasthyaḥ sattrimsat | dasamyo vimśatiḥ |).
8.14-8.18 Placement of bricks in the second layer. The arrangement of bricks is shown in Fig. 34. After leaving 48 angulas at the end of the southern wing, 3 B ̧s are placed at the western and the eastern side each towards north, and 3 Bås in the middle; the space (that is, two rows, south-north) in between these three rows is filled with 4 B1s. D. explains this placement as follows: aratnidvaye'tite pakṣapaścimapārśva udicyastisraḥ

CHAPTER 10
CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON
WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-FIRST TYPE.
10.1. This type of fire-altar is constructed more in the likeness of a falcon. To achieve this the two wings are to be curved or bent and the tail is to be extended, that is, spread out. The body (ātman) itself should be cut out at its four corners, and there should be a head. The end of each wing is serrated to give it the appearance of being provided with feathers (patra). The laying of this type of firc-altar on the part of those who desire heaven has been greatly emphasized in the Brāhmaṇas. Here are a few excerpts from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa : “Prajāpati was desirous of going up to the world of heaven ;................ He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so. By contracting and expanding (the wings) he did fly up whence even to this day birds can only fly up when they contract their wings and spread their feathers"a. Again, "He contracts (the right wing) inside on both sides by just four finger-breadths, and expands it outside on both sides by four finger- breadths;...... In the same way with regard to the tail, and in the same way in regard to the left wing."b
10.2-10.3. Types of bricks. For building a fire-altar of this shape which is fully described in what follows, rectilinear bricks alone would not do. Bricks of other geometrical shapes are needed, which are first dealt with. In the first type under consideration in this chapter, the following five types have been prescribed (Fig. 37).
B1
B2
one-fourth (caturthi) square brick-30 × 30 sq. angulas; that is, a square whose side AB is ‡ pu. or 30 añgulas.

B2- half brick (ardhā) obtained by cutting the one-fourth square brick diagonally; each of 2 sides AB, AC equals 30 angulas and the diagonal side or hypoteneuse BC 30 √2 angulas.

four-sided quarter brick (caturaśra-pādyā), of which CD equals 10 angulas, BC 15 angulas, AB 22 angulas, AD 15 √2 angulas. 1 pada being 15 angulas, the measures are given here in angulas. padasaviseṣa means the diagonal of a square of side 1 pada or 15 angulas or the hypoteneuse of a right-isosceles triangle of side 15 angulas. Clearly, such a figure is obtained by joining the rectangle EBCD with the isosceles right triangle AED along the common side ED. Its

Areas and Shapes of different parts of the Fire-ALTAR.
10.4-10.9. The body: A rectangle ABCD is drawn with AB equal to 2 pu. or 240 ang. and AD 10 padas or 150 ang. (Fig. 38 (a) ). FD, DG, HC, CI, BJ, BK, AL and AE are measured out such that each equals 45 ang. (=11⁄2 prakrama). Join FG, HI, JK and LE. EFGHIJKL is the body of the altar, with its four corners cut off as laid down in the rule. The area is (240 x 1802 × 45 × 45) sq. angulas or sq. pu.
11⁄2 The commentator measures the area in a unit of șoḍaśi which is 1/16 sq. pu. or 30 x 30 sq. angulas, also called a caturthi, the area of B1. In this unit, the area of the body reduces to 351 caturthis,—evamāṭmaśroṇyamseṣvardhapañcamāścaturthyo nirastā bhavanti | atha ŝiṣṭā ardhaṣaṣṭhāstriṛśaccaturthyo bhavanti |—D.
The head: A rectangle ABCD is formed with AB equal to 821⁄2 ang. and BC = 60 ang. (Fig. 38 (b)). From the centre E of AD, EF and EG are joined, AE, ED, AG, DF each being equal to 30 ang. EGBCF is the head measuring 41 caturthis or sq. pu. (itarā ardhapañcamāḥ śiro bhavanti—D.).
192
BAUDHAYANA-SULBASŪTRA
The tail: The tail is formed out of a rectangle ABCD, of which AB is 90 ang. and BC 240 ang., by cutting off the two triangles ABE and CDF, where AB = AE = CD FD = 90 ang. (Fig. 38 (c) ). The areas of the tail EBCF is 15 caturthis or 18 sq. pu.
The wings: A rectangle ABCD, of which AB is 150 ang. and BC 180 ang., is formed (Fig. 38 (d)). At the mid-point P of BC a perpendicular PE is drawn towards east so that PE is 90 ang. Then the triangle EBC is cut off and placed on the eastern side AD as the triangle FAD. The area of the figure ABECDF remains the same as the rectangle ABCD. In this way the wing is bent or curved (nirṇāma). That the area is not affected by bending in this way is clearly recognized in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa: "He then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked.........he thus draws them out by just as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size) nor does he make it too small.""
For the construction of the plumages, five squares DGK11, L1K1KL2 etc. are drawn with side 30 ang. and intersected by the diagonals DK1, L1K, etc. The outer triangular halves DGK1, L1K1K2 etc. are cut off.
1 2
This is the construction of the southern wing; the northern wing is constructed in the same manner. The area of each wing is 32 caturthis and of two wings 65 caturthis or sq. pu.

10.10-10.14. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks is shown in Fig. 39 (a) and (b). Two methods are given for the head; the second method is shown in (b). In each case the number of bricks employed is 14. At the eastern and the western end of the body near the junctions with the head and the tail 5 B ̧s are placed. In the truncated parts, B2s and Bas are placed. Since the head has already been covered, this means placement in the 4 corners of the body, 2 sides of the wing (excluding the western end), eastern and western sides of the curved wings and the feathers at the end. The rest is filled with B1 bricks.

As pointed out by Thibaut, the bricks specifically mentioned in the sūtras 10.10- 10.12 total 68; the remaining space, as per sūtra 10.13, can be filled with 91 B1 bricks thus giving a total number of 159 bricks which fall short of 200 bricksa.
The deficit is to be made good by using B2s and B ̧s as necessary. Dvārakānātha explains that there are 12 rows south-north in the tail and the body excluding the head and the wing (sirovarjam pucchena sahātmanyudicyo dvādaśa ritayaḥ). Starting from

At the junction EF between the tail and the body 2 Bgs and 3 B2s are placed and at the end of the tail 15 Bgs. The end of the wing containing the plumages, TJKLMNOPQRST, is divided into 5 sections in each of which 1 B2 and 2 B,s can be placed. The bricks thus mentioned total 58,-centre of the body 8, junction of the tail with body 5, tail end 15, and plumages at two wings 30.

In the truncated areas, bendings of the wings and junctions (other than already mentioned), B2s and B2s are to be placed; as per Fig. 40, these are : B,—28; B,—14, total 42. In area, these 100 bricks are equivalent to 36 caturthis. Since the total area is 120 caturthis, the remaining space can be filled by only 84 B1s, leaving a deficit of 16 bricks. This is met by replacing 16 B1s by 32 B2s. D. proposes to do this in the following manner. In the wings, the body including the head, there are 18 rows west- east starting from the south. In Fig. 40, 9 rows are marked from the south to the central east-west line, there being another such 9 rows in the other half. 6 B1s in the 8th row between the two extreme B2s and 2 B1s west of B2 in the head in the 9th

CHAPTER 11.
CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-SECOND TYPE
11.2-11.3. Measurement of the different parts. We have noticed the use of a new unit of square measure, the caturthi, 30 × 30 sq. angulas in the case of the fyenacit of the first type. Now another unit, the pañcami, 24 × 24 sq. angulas or 1 sq. aratni (a square of side one-fifth of a purusa) is introduced. Clearly, 7 sq. pu. is equivalent
15 × 120 x 120
to
2 × 24 × 24
or 1871 pañcamis, as stated in the rule 11.2. These units are
distributed in the various parts of the fire-altar as follows:

These given areas must be satisfied in constructing the figures of the various parts as we shall see in the following sūtras.
11.4. Construction of different parts of the falcon. Unlike the falcon of the first type detailed measurements of the various rectangles involved have not been given. However, with the indications given in the rule and the areas in the previous rules, the various parts can be constructed without difficulty.
The body is made out of a rectangle ABCD (Fig. 41(a) ), of which AD=144 angulas or 6 aratnis, AB = 240 angulas or 10 aratnis and the area 60 sq. aratnis. By the cutting of the corners at distances of 2 aratnis (48 angulas), 8 sq. aratnis are removed so that EFGHIJKL measures exactly 52 sq. aratnis.
The head is constructed out of a rectangle 48 × 54 sq. ang. (AE AG ED
24 angulas) such that EFCBG measures 3 sq. aratnis.
DF
The tail is done in the same way as before. Here AD equals 8 aratnis (192 angulas), AB 3 aratnis (72 añgulas) and the area 24 sq. aratnis (Fig. 41 (c) ). AB, AE, FD, DC being equal to 3 aratnis, 9 sq. aratnis are removed, leaving the area of the tail EBCF as 15 sq. aratnis.
For the wing, the rectangle to be taken should have its side AD as 9 aratnis 216 angulas) and AB 6 aratnis (144 ang.); the area is 54 sq. aratnis. The bending (nirṇāma) is made as before, the distance EP being 3 aratnis (72 angulas). For the plumages, 6 rectangles DGK1L1, L1K1K‚L1⁄2 etc. are fitted at the end of the tail,
COMMENTARY
197
diagonally intersected and outer halves rejected. Now, each such rectangle is adhyardhā-pañcami, that is, 36 × 24 sq. angulas or 11⁄2 sq. aratni; the area of 6 of them is 9 sq. aratnis and that of the 6 plumages (patra) after rejection of half is 4 sq. aratnis. The total area of each wing is, therefore, 58 sq. aratnis and that of two wings 117 sq. aratnis.

11.10-11.13. Placement of bricks in the second layer. By placing B, bricks (ubhayi) at the eastern and the western end of the junction line between the wing and the body such that 12 ang. of the base lies in the body and 18 ang. in the wing, the sūtrakāra avoids the overlapping of edges of bricks in the two layers (Fig. 44). This is also the purpose of placing B,s on each side of the head and Bas at the end of the tail flanked at the western corners by Bыs and B10s. For the complete arrangement of bricks, we again follow the commentator who this time divides the tail, the body and the head in 12 rows beginning with the 1st row at the western end of the tail and ending with the the 12th row at the head. In this division the wing with part of the junction lying in the body is separately treated as before.

In his commentary, D. states 9 bricks in the head, 62 in the body, 21 in the tail and 108 in the wings; that is, he includes in the body 20 bricks at the two junctions of the wings with the body and 2 Bs at the junction of the tail with the body. In the number of brick types, there is no discrepancy: asminprastāre ekādaśa pañcamyaḥ | dvādaśa tadardhyāḥ | ekādaśa taṭṭādyāḥ | dve aṣṭamyau | ekavimśatiḥ | ubhayyo'ṣṭau | sapta- ṣaṣṭiradhyardhāḥ | catustriṛśadardhyāḥ | aṣṭāvimśatidirghapādyāḥ | ṣaṭ śūlapādyāḥ |. 
CHAPTER 12 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A KITE (KAŃKACIT) 
12.1-12.6. The kite-shaped fire-altar (kańkacit) is constructed in the same manner as the syenacit. The areas and shapes of the body and the tail are the same as those of the second type of the falcon with curved wings and extended tail. The area of the body is, therefore, 52 pañcamis or sq. aratnis and of the tail 15 pañcamis. The measure of the head is given as 5 pañcamis and that of the two wings 2 × 57 or 114 pañcamis. These areas total 186 pañcamis or sq. aratnis, leaving a deficit of 11⁄2 pañcamis, as the total area of the fire-altar is 1871⁄2 pañcamis (= 71⁄2 sq. pu.) This balance area of 11⁄2 pañcamis, which is nothing but 1 adhyardhāpañcami (24 × 36 sq. ang.) is utilized in making the feet of the bird. The bending of the wing and the plumages are also slightly different from those of the syenacit, 2nd type. The constructions are shown in Fig. 45. 
COMMENTARY

The head is constructed out of a rectangle 48 × 72 sq. ang. of which the two eastern corners are cut off by 24 ang. (Fig. 45 (a)).

Fig. 45. Parts of the kankacit : (a) head, (b) tail, (c) divisions of 1 adhyardhā- 
pañcami, and (d) the wing with plumages. 
The construction of the tail EBCF is already explained under 11.4. ABCD (Fig. 45 (c)) represents the adhyardhāpañcami (24 x 36 sq. ang.), of which the pañcami part ABHG is halved and used as the two legs GILK and JHNM (Fig. 45 (b)). The half pañcami part GHCD (Fig. 45 (c)) is divided into 4 equal triangular parts and used as feet as shown in Fig. 45 (b). 
The wing is made of the rectangle ABCD (Fig. 45 (d)), of which AB=144 ang. (6 aratnis) and AD = 216 ang. (9 aratnis). For the bending, the perpendicular EP at the middle of BC is 108 ang. The plumages are constructed out of 6 half pañcamis (24 × 24 sq. ang.) diagonally intersected. Note that the area of each wing is 54 + 3 
57 pañcamis. 
12.7. Types of bricks. Six types of bricks are prescribed for covering the fire-altar (Fig. 46). These are :

12.8. Placement of bricks in the two layers. The rule simply lays down that the two feet of the kankacit are to be covered by B, and B, bricks and the remaining space is to be filled up by such types as these fit. Further details have been avoided as enough indications as to the manner of covering up such bird-like fire-altars with curved wings and extended tail have been given in the foregoing types. Following these indications, Dvārakānātha has proposed an arrangement for filling up the two successive layers, on which basis the Fig. 47 and Fig. 48 are here presented, after Thibaut.

As the total area of the fire-altar must be 1871 pañcamis or sq. aratnis, 101⁄2 pañcamis are to be removed from the wings. The construction of the wing and the method of removing the excess area are explained in 13.3-13.5, 13.6 (part). 
The area of each wing being 63 pañcamis and 6 plumages, each of half-pañcami, needing an area of 3 pañcamis only by analogy with the kankacit wing, the rectangular area forming the main part of the wing to be bent should measure 60 pañcamis or 6 aratnis × 10 aratnis (144 ang. × 240 añg.). ABCD is such a rectangle of which AB 144 ang. and BC 240 ang. After bending, it assumes the form ABECDF so that EP = IF = 120 ang. IE clearly equals 24 ang. or I aratni. The patras are DK11, LKL2 etc. From the geometry it is clear that I, J, L5 H lie on the same straight line. Hence the direction (rule 13.4) that, by stretching a cord IH, the area IECH west of the southern half of the wing including the patras should be cut off. The

The first line of rule 13.6 prescribes that a triangular area EIJ measuring a quarter brick, that is ‡ pañcami is to be added. In other words, the actual area to be removed is ECHJ measuring (51 — 1) or 51 pañcami; for two wings the area to be removed is 10 pañcami.

CHAPTER 14 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE (PRAUGACITI) 
14.2. Measurement of the fire-altar and the types of bricks. The area of the fire-altar should be 71 sq. pu. Under rule 2.7, Baudhayana has shown that an isosceles triangle of 71 sq. pu. can be drawn from a square of double this area, that is, 15 sq. pu., by joining the mid-point E of the eastern side AD with two western corner points B and C (Fig. 52). The base BC and each side EB, EC are given by

15.3. Placement of bricks in the first layer. BC is divided into 18 equal parts and marked and likewise GH in 18 equal parts and marked. Lines parallel to BC and GH are drawn. It is easily seen that the entire area is divided into 144 rectangles where an equal number of bṛhati bricks can be placed and into 36 half rectangles along the sides where an equal number of ardhyās can be placed. Thus we get 180 bricks. The deficit is met by replacing 10 B1s in the 6th vertical row on either side of the central line GH by 20 B2s. With the above substitution, the total number of B1s is 124 and that of B2s 76.

CHAPTER 16 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A 
CHARIOT WHEEL (RATHACAKRACITI) 
215 
16.1-16.2. Fire-altars in the form of a chariot-wheel are of two types: (a) a square piece with four circular segments attached one on each side so as to give the whole structure a circular shape, and (b) a circular wheel provided with spokes. Both types. are used for sacrificial purposes and are described in this chapter. 
THE CHARIOT WHEEL WITH CIRCULAR SEGMENTS. 
16.3. The construction and brick types. The method of constructing a circle equivalent to that of a square area, in this case 7 sq. pu., has been given in rule 2.9 and has already been discussed. Fig. 59 represents the required circle of area 7 sq. pu., within which is drawn the largest possible square ABCD. The space bounded by each side of the square and the arc of the circle is called pradhi (segment); there are four such segments. 
Let the side of the square AB or AD be a and the radius of the circle AO be r.

Fig. 59 
In the above calculations, π has been taken to be 3.14. D. gives the value of r as 185 ang. 14 ti. (madhye śańkum nihatya pañcāśītiśatāñngulena caturdaśatilayuktena pariman- dala bhramayet). His value of a is 262 ang. 7 ti (tasya madhye viskambhārdhadvikaraṇyā (r √2) saptatiladhikayā dviṣaṣṭiśatadvayāngulayā samacaturaśram kuryāt). It appears that in giving these values Dvārakānātha used the more approximate correct value of л. The square bricks are then made with each side equal to the twelfth part of AD, which, according to D's value of the side of the inscribed square, is 21 ang. 29 ti (that is, 22 ang- 5 ti). 
16.4-16.5. Placement of bricks. 144 bricks of the type mentioned above can be placed within the square ABCD. In the segments, 6 such bricks are placed adjoining the middle side of the square and the remaining space is divided into 8 parts (Fig. 60 (a), (b)). Thus each segment contains 14 bricks and four segments account for 56 bricks, making the total number 200. Regarding the placement of bricks in each segment, D. explains as follows: pradhimulamadhye ṣaț caturaśră upadhāya tasya pradheḥ sesamaṣṭadhā vibhajet | upahitānām ṣaṇṇām pārsvayordve dve mukhe catasra iti [

ag, hg, ih and ji are curved. D. neglected the curvature of ag, but considered the rest by giving the values of the śara, the distance between the centre of the arc and the respective chord in each case. For hg, ih and ji, these values are 31 ti; 26 ti., and 25 ti. respectively. Calculation of arcs and their saras were obviously consi- dered important mathematical exercises in medieval India when these commentaries were prepared. 
In the second layer the inscribed square is turned such that its corner lies in the centre of each segment of the first layer in order to avoid the overlapping of the edges of the bricks between layers. 
THE CHARIOT WHEEL WITH SPOKES. 
16.6-16.11. The measurement and the construction of the wheel. For purposes of measure- ment of a wheel of this type, square bricks each of area sq. pu. are used. 
15 x 30 The total area of the fire-altar, 1 sq. pu. will therefore involve 
or 225 bricks. The side of each brick a is given by :

Fig. 61. Construction of the chariot wheel (rathacakra) fire-altar. 
Now, 225 is a squared number 152. A chariot wheel with spokes consists of the central circular part, the nave, the spokes and the outer circular rim, the felly. The spokes connecting the nave and the felly alternate with empty spaces. In the procedure suggested, an area equivalent to the empty spaces between spokes is first added and then removed. This area is here taken to be equivalent to that of 64 square bricks of the type described above, probably because 225 plus 64 make 289, a squared number 172. Hence the direction of arranging 289 bricks in the form of a square so that each side contains 17 bricks. This is done in two stages; at first 256 bricks are arranged in a square, each side containing 16 bricks, and then 33 bricks, -17 plus 16, are placed along two adjoining sides. In this way the square ABCD is formed (Fig. 61 ). 
In the central region of the above square, another square EFGH of 16 bricks is formed. As D. explains, it is constructed out of the central square of 25 bricks by putting 4 poles, one each at the centre of the corner bricks, at E, F, G and H, and then joining them. The square EFGH forms the nave (nābhi). 
In the same manner, another square IJKL is formed of 144 bricks, centrally placed within ABCD. This is again done out of a square of 169 bricks, each side containing 13 bricks. A pole is placed at the centre of each of the four corner bricks, I, J, K and L, and these poles are joined. The area between the squares IJKL and EFGH is equivalent to the area of 128 (144-16) bricks, half of which, that is, 64, is used for making the spokes (arā) and the remaining half (64 bricks) for the empty spaces (vedi). 
218 
BAUDHĀYANA-ŠULBASUTRA 
The space between the squares ABCD and IJKL, equivalent to 145 (289-144) bricks constitutes the felly (nemi). 
Then three squares ABCD, EFGH and IJKL are turned into circles of radii OM, OP and ON respectively, according to the method given in rule 2.9. The space between the felly and the nave, that is between the circles of radii ON and OP is radially divided into 32 equal parts and half of them, in alternate order, is removed. In this way, an area equivalent to that of 64 bricks is rejected, and the remaining area of the wheel with the nave, spokes and the felly is exactly equal to that of 225 bricks or 7 sq. pu. 
16.12-16.14. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The felly (nemi) is divided into 64 equal parts. We have seen that the annular space comprising the spokes and the empty spaces was divided into 32 equal parts by radial lines. These are projected into the felly, dividing it at first into 32 equal parts, and each part is then equally divided by radial lines confined between the outer and the inner circumference. Now a concentric circle passing through the middle of these two circumferences of the felly is drawn, dividing its space into 128 parts. Note that the area of each part lying outside the middle circumference is different from that lying within. Accordingly, two types of bricks are required to cover the felly, as D. points out -- hāhyāścatuḥṣaṣṭi | tāsāmekam karaṇam | antataścatuḥṣaṣṭi | tāsāmekam karaṇam | 
Fig. 62. Arrangement of bricks in the 1st layer (after Thibaut). 
Each spoke is divided into 4 parts, thereby involving the use of 64 bricks of four different types. Finally the nave is divided into 8 equal parts to make the total number of bricks in the first layer 200. Thus seven different types of bricks are required to cover the first layer-evam sapta karaṇāni | eṣa prathamaḥ prastāraḥ | evam fatadvayasampattiḥ -D.

COMMENTARY 
Fig. 63. Arrangement of bricks in the 2nd layer (after Thibaut). 
16.15-16-20. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The general principle of avoiding overlapping of cleavages of bricks in the two layers is to be kept in view. For this reason, a circle shorter by one-fourth ( OP) is drawn within the nave; its distance from the edge is therefore a quarter. In the felly, a concentric circle is drawn so that its distance from the inner edge is one-fourth the breadth of the felly (nemimabhyan- tarato nemipramāṇacaturthabhāge'tite parikṛṣet—D.) 
The annular space of the felly between this new circle and the outermost one is divided into 64 equal parts and filled with bricks of one type. Each of the 16 spokes extending from the newly drawn inner circle in the nave upto the newly drawn inner circle of the felly is divided into 5 parts and 5 different types of bricks are used. The spokes will thus involve the use of 80 bricks. In between spokes, in the region of the felly, there are 16 spaces, each of which is divided into two equal parts, and 32 bricks of another type are used to fill them up (arāṇāmantarāleṣu vedipradeśasamipe nemyām dve dve iṣṭake | ....tāsāmṣkam karaṇam | tā dvātriṛśat—D.). Likewise, there are 16 spaces in the nave between the spokes and outside the inner circle; 16 bricks of another size are used to cover them. The remaining central part of the nave is radially divided into 8 parts and 8 bricks of still another type are employed to cover them. In this way, the total number of 200 (64 + 80 + 32 + 16 + 8) bricks of 9 different types are used. With the 7 types used for the first layer, and 9 for the second 16 different types of bricks are used to construct the fire-altar in the shape of a chariot wheel with spokes.

17.7. Placement of bricks in the first layer. 6 B, bricks are placed on each of BE and HC, that is, along line between the two western corners and the points where the handle meets the body. The remaining space can be filled with 172 Bys,-160 in the body and 12 in the handle including part of the body. In this way 12 B1s and 172 B2s, totalling 184 bricks, can be placed. The deficit of 16 bricks can be met by using Bås in place of B1s and B2s. According to Dvārakānātha, 4 B2s at the end of the handle are replaced by 4 B1s and 4 B ̧s and 12 B1s along BE and CH are replaced by 24 B,s. Now we have 4 B1s, 168 B2s and 28 B3s. (asmin prastāre catasraḥ ṣasthyaḥ | aṣṭaṣaṣṭisatamadhyardhāḥ | aṣṭāvimśatirardhyāḥ |--D.) 
17.8-17.12. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The method of placement is very clearly explained in these sutras and is shown in Fig. 65. After placing 2 Bås, one on each of the two eastern corners, 13 B1s can be placed on the eastern side of the body. 10 Bs are placed on each of the southern and the northern side. The tail contains 9 bricks, -2 B1s, 5 B2s and 2 B1s. The remaining space in the body can accommodate just 130 Bs. The total number of bricks thus used is as follows: B1-15; B2-137; B, 22; total 174. There is a deficit of 26 bricks, which is met by B, bricks. According to Dvårakånåtha, after replacement of B2s by B2s, the number of bricks of different types stands as follows : B1 
15; B2 124; 
3

B2- - 39; and B-22; total - 200. Clearly 13 B2s are replaced by 39 Bås.

FIRE-ALTARS

CIRCULAR TROUGH 
20 
18.1-18.6. The construction of the fire-altar. For purposes of measurements, the ṣoḍaśī square bricks of area sq. pu. or 900 sq. ang. (that is, 30 × 30 sq. ang.) are employed. Clearly, 120 ṣoḍaśi bricks equal 122 or 71⁄2 sq. pu., the area of the fire- altar to be constructed. This area equals 108000 sq. ang. After deducting the area of 1 ṣoḍaśi brick of 900 sq. ang., the balance of 107, 100 sq. ang. is converted into a square of which the side obtained by taking the square root works out to.327 ang. 9 tila. Dvārakānātha gives this value as follows: tasya mulamāniya navatilasahita- saptavimśatyangulasahita-ŝatatrayāngulapramāṇena samacaturaśram kṛtvā 
The next step is to convert the above-mentioned square into a circle by the method given in sūtra Bśl. 2.9. and already applied in the case of the fire-altar in the form of the chariot wheel. Let ABCD be the square of side equal to 327 ang. 9 tila. (Fig. 66 ). EFGH is the ṣoḍāśi brick placed at the middle of the eastern side AD of the square. With O as centre and OM as radius a circle equal in area of the square ABCD is drawn, cutting EFGH by the curved line (dhanurvakrā) IJ. The 
222 
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA 
part of the sodasi brick IFGJ cut by the circle is transferred to the top of the remain- ing portion, as KEHL. Now, KIJL, whose area remains the same as that of a ṣoḍaśi brick, represents the handle of the circular trough (also called oṣṭha).

18.7-18.9. Arrangement of bricks in the first layer. A square PQRS as large as possi- ble is inscribed within the circle of the fire-altar as constructed above. The side PQ is given by

The commentator's value is 261 ang. 4 ti, which closely agrees with our value. 
COMMENTARY 
Square bricks are made with side equal to 
223 
PQ, that is, 21 ang. 26 ti (= & 
of 261 ang. 6 ti), which is also the value given by the commentator (......tasya karanya dvādasena şaḍvimśati tilasahitenaikavimsatyangulena pramāneneṣṭakaḥ kuryat). The inscribed square PQRS is filled with 144 such bricks. 6 such bricks are placed in each of the four segments in the middle of, and touching, the square; 24 such bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is divided into 7 parts as shown in Fig. 67 (a), making their number 28. The brick in the centre of the segment in between the row of 6 bricks and the circumference of the circle is 30 ang. broad and is called pradhi madhyamā. With 2 bricks in the handle, as cut by the circle already described, the number of bricks in the first layer totals 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 corner bricks within the square by 4 half bricks of the one- twelfth type diagonally cut.

18.10-18.11. Arrangement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned such that the corners point towards intermediate directions Fig. 67(b). The square is filled with 144 one-twelfth bricks as before and 24 similar bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is also divided into 7 parts as in the first layer, making their number 28. To avoid overlapping of edges, the pradhi madhyamā brick is placed in the handle, and the space below is equally divided. The total number aggregates to 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 one-twelfth bricks in the square by 4 half bricks. 
Types of bricks. The sūtras do not specifically describe the types of bricks. From the descriptions, it is, however, clear that nine types of bricks are used. B1, B2, B3, B and B types are used in each segment; B, and B, in the handle; B。 is used in the centre of the segment in one layer; and B,s are used to complete the number 200. The following particulars of the bricks are based on the commentary (Fig. 68).

THE SAMUHYA AND THE PARICAYYA FIRE-ALTAR. 18.12-18.15. These sutras deal with samuhya and paricayya fire-altars. These altars are circular in shape and constructed in the same manner as the chariot wheel without spokes. The samūhya is not covered with bricks, but by loose earth dug out from pits, as stated in the sūtra. 
The paricayya is, however, covered with bricks in concentric circles. According to Dvārakānātha, 6 equally spaced concentric circles (agnikṣetre samāntarālāni ṣaṇmaṇ- dalāni) are drawn. The central circle, the nabhi, is divided into 8 equal parts. Beginning from the nābhi, the second and the third annular spaces are each divided into 16 equal parts; the fourth annular space is divided into 32 equal parts; and the fifth and the sixth annular spaces are each divided into 64 equal parts. In this way, 200 bricks are completed for the first layer. There are six different types of 
COMMENTARY 
225 
bricks, for the dimensions of radial divisions differ from one annular ring to the other (pratimaṇḍalam karaṇabhedaḥ | evam ṣaṭ karaṇāni). In the other layer, concentric circles are drawn in the middle of each annular ring and the inner circle (of the first layer) is removed. Here also we have 6 concentric circles but of different radii. The division of the nābhi and the succeeding annular rings is the same as before; but the radial lines are to be drawn such that these do not coincide with those of the first layer. All these are done to avoid the overlapping of edges. Here also 6 different types of bricks are used. 
CHAPTER 19 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A PYRE 
(ŚMAŚĀNACIT). 
19.1-19.2. The fire-altar in the form of a pyre, as we shall presently see, is a trapezium. For its measurements and constructions as also for the bricks, a new unit has been introduced. Let p be this unit. According to rule 19.2,

BAUDHAYANA-SULBASUTRA 
The fire-altar is in the form of a trapezium ABCD, of which the western side BC is 2p units (= 170 ang. 12 tila), the eastern side AD is 3p ( 254 ang. + 16 tila) and the height, that is, the distance between AD and BC is 6p (509 ang. - - 2 tila) (Fig. 69). For the word trapezium, the word ekato'nimaddirghacaturaśra is used. It means a rectangle of which one side is shorter (than the opposite parallel side). The area of the trapezium is given by 
15 
2p × 6p + 2 × 6p = 15p2 = −2 sq. pu. = which satisfies the area of the agnikṣetra. 
71 sq. pu. 
First layer. For purposes of making the bricks, a rectangle ABCD is formed such that its length AB is 3p and breadth BC is 3p. From the mid-point E of AD, join EB, EC. EBC is an isosceles triangle (prauga) of area p2. 20 such praugas equal 15p2 or 7 sq. pu. and can be accommodated within the fire-altar. To attain the number 200, each such isosceles triangle is divided into 10 parts in the manner shown in Fig. 69(b). The sides EB, EC and BC are each divided into 4 equal parts by marking 3 equidistant points on each side. The points on the sides are joined with those on the base as shown, so as to obtain 4 isosceles triangles at the base and 6 double isosceles triangles above them. About the formation of such triangles, the commentator says: evam vibhakte pṛthvanikasthāḥ praugākārāścatasra iṣṭakāḥ | tatastisra ubhayataḥ praugākṛtayaḥ | tato dve | tata ekā cubukāntā | 
Regarding the placement of 20 isosceles triangles EBC of area ap2, a line EF is drawn in the middle of the body (Fig. 69a). In the eastern half, 11 such triangles can be placed, 6 with vertices turned west and 5 with vertices turned east. In

the western half, 9 such triangles can be accommodated, 5 with vertices turned west and 4 with vertices turned east. This represents the arrangement of bricks in which 80 praugas and 120 ubhayata praugas are used. 
19.5-19.7. Bricks and their placement in the second layer. The entire space of the fire-altar (agnikṣetra) can be divided into five large isosceles triangles of base p and height (from vertex to base) 6p. Three of them have their vertices turned towards west and the vertices of the two in between them are turned towards east. The two isosceles triangles, one on the southern side and the other on the northern, which have their vertices turned towards west, are bisected by perpendicular lines drawn from the vertex to the base (Fig. 71). The agnikṣetra is thus divided into three portions, (1) half isosceles triangle CDE on the southern side, (2) the half isosceles triangle BAF on the northern side, and (3) the rectangle BCEF in the middle. Note that, since ED and AF are each ≥þ, EF 
www 
BC 
=== 
2p. 
To make the different types of bricks, the half isosceles triangle on either side is divided into six parts (Fig. 70). AB, BC and AC are divided into three equal parts each by the points, a, b, c, d, e, and f. Join bc, ad, de and cgf. The space is thus divided into 3 half isosceles triangles Bbc, cdg and dce which constitute the first type of brick B1. Note that Bb = 2p, bc = g. Through the above division, we get the second type B2, the rectangular bricks abcg, Aagƒ and fgde, of which the sides are 2p and p . The third type B, called the bṛhati, is a rectangular brick ABCD (Fig. 70(b)), of which AB p and AD p. The fourth type B is half bṛhati (Fig. 70(c)), a rectangular brick measuring p/4 by p/6. 
4 
The arrangement of bricks in the second layer is shown in Fig. 71. 3B1s and 3 B2s are placed in each of the two half-isosceles parts of the fire-altar. 8 B1s are placed on the eastern and the western parts each of the rectangular part of the fire- altar, with the longer side turned north-south. (Note that 2p/p = 8). These two rows use up up and the remaining vertical distance is (6p—g) — 172. The remaining space in the rectangular part of the fire-altar can be divided into 17 horizontal and 8 vertical rows in which 136 B bricks can be fitted with their longer sides turned east. Thus, the number of bricks used in this way totals as follows : 
B1 
6; B2 6 ; Bз 
3 
3 
136; B4- 16; total 
164. 
There is still a deficit of 36 bricks. According to the commentator, the deficit can be met by replacing 36 B, bricks (9 from each of the 4 corners) by 72 B1s. Dvārakā- nātha says: pārśvayorupahitapraugārdhayordvādaśeṣṭakāḥ | madhyabhūtacaturaśra (pūrvā) parāntayoḥ ṣoḍaśārdheṣṭakāḥ | madhye şaṭtrimsacchalam bṛhatyaḥ prāgāyatāḥ | evam catuḥṣaṣṭi satamiṣṭakaḥ ṣaṭtrimśannyūnā bhavanti | śronyamseṣu nava nava bṛhatiścaturasrakṛtā uddhṛtyāṣṭādaśāṣṭāḍaśārdhyā nidheyāḥ | evam dviśataḥ prastārāḥ | 
19.9-19.11. These sūtras deal with the height of the fire-altars and do not call for much comment.

CHAPTER 20 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A TORTOISE 
(KŪRMACIT)—FIRST TYPE WITH TWISTED LIMBS 
20.1-20.2. Fire-altars in the form of a tortoise are of two types, (1) the tortoise with twisted limbs (vakrāngāḥ) and (2) the tortoise with rounded limbs (parimaṇḍalāḥ). The construction of the first type is described in this chapter. 
= 
20.3-20.7. The construction of the fire-altar. A square of side 10 prakamas or 300 ang is first constructed and the four corners are cut off by 30 ang (that is, an isosceles tri- angle of two equal sides, each 30 ang is removed from each corner. A B C D E F G H is the shape of the body thus obtained (Fig. 72). Note that AB CD EF HG 60√2 ang. and BC DE FG AH = 180 ang. Four squares, each of side 30 ang. are placed side by side in contact with the middle of the eastern side of the body AH. Outer halves of the two side squares are diagonally cut off so as to get the figure a b c d. Note that ab equals 60 ang. Similar figures are constructed in the middle of the other three sides of the body BC, DE and FG.

The head is constructed by placing a rectangle on ab (ab of which length or height is 75 ang; the two eastern corners are then cut off by 30 ang each so as to get the shape efabg for the head. 
For each foot, a rectangle 30√2 ang. broad by 60√2 ang long is placed in the middle of the cut off corner, say on HG for the south-east corner. Thereupon, the eastern corner of this rectangle is cut off by 30√2 ang so as to obtain hijk for the shape of the foot. Similar constructions are made upon EF, CD and AB to build the remaining feet.

20.12-20.15. The placement of bricks in the first layer. As per sūtras, 1B, is to be placed at the tip of the head and below it 2 B5s (Fig. 73). In each foot 5 Bes and 2 B2s are placed as shown in the figure. In the remaining space, B2s are placed wherever the corners are cut diagonally and B1s in the rest. Clearly, the number 200 cannot be arrived at in this way; so B1s are replaced by Bos as necessary. According to the commentary, this can be done in the following way. Excluding the feet, the whole space of the fire-altar can be divided into 12 vertical rows, 6 on the southern side of the line passing through the centre of the body and the tip of the head and 6 on its northern side. In the first 6 rows from the southernmost one, the arrang ement is as follows :-

Thus there is a deficit of 41 bricks (ekacatvāriṛśadūnāḥ). This deficit is met by replac ing 40 B1s (5B,s from each of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th rows of each of the southern and the northern halves of the agnikṣetra) by 80 Bs. Also I B1 in the head is replaced by 2 Bas. Dvārakānātha says: tṛtiyādiṣu catasṛsu pañca pañca caturthiruddhṛtyam catvāri-

CHAPTER 21 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A 
TORTOISE-SECOND TYPE WITH ROUNDED LIMBS. 
as 
21.2-21-4. The construction. Here the method of construction is the same that already described in the case of the circular trough (chapter 18). We have seen that 120 sodasi bricks equal 71⁄2 sq. pu. 5 ṣoḍaśi bricks are taken out and the area of the remaining 115 ṣoḍaśis (103500 sq. ang.) is turned into a square of side 321 ang. 24 ti (the commentator's value is 321 ang. 25 ti). This square is transformed into a circle of the same area as per Bśl. 2.9. In this act of circling the square, each of the 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks is cut by the circle and the western portion transferred to the eastern side. In this way, each of the 5 şoḍasi bricks is rounded off, one of them forms the head and the remaining 4 are attached to the circle in the 4 intermediate directions (Fig. 75). 
The next step is to draw within the circle a square of the maximum possible area. The side of the inscribed square, as we have calculated, works out to 256 ang. 25 ti. 
21.5-21.9. The side of the inscribed square, 256 ang. 25 ti is divided into 12 equal parts, and squared bricks are formed with side equal to each such part, that is, 21 ang. 13 ti which agrees with the value of the commentator (trayodaŝatilasahitaika- vimsatyanguleneṣṭakaḥ). But the commentator's value of 255 ang. 19 ti for the side of the inscribed square is inaccurate inasmuch as it leads to 21 ang. and 10 ti as the side of the square brick and not 21 ang. 13 ti as mentioned.
